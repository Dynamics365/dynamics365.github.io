      <description>In Dynamics 365 finance and operations, Business events provide a mechanism that lets external systems receive notifications from FinOps applications. In this way, the systems can perform business actions in response to business events.
There are 3 types of business events: Application business events, Workflow business events, and Alerts as business events. You can also implement a new business event.
Business events can be consumed using Microsoft Flow and Azure messaging services, and we use endpoint to manage the destinations for sending business events to, Microsoft supports many endpoints: Azure Service Bus Queue, Azure Service Bus Topic, Azure Event Grid, Azure Event Hub, HTTPS, Microsoft Flow.</description>
