      <description>Dual-write has been around for almost two years now. Itâ€™s one of the ways of integrating Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations and Dataverse along with Virtual Entities.
The standard solution comes with many out-of-the-box entities available to synchronize. This has been one of the great improvements since Dual-write was made available in preview, when Juanan and I demoed it in the 2019 Dynamics Saturday in Madrid.
This is how Dual write really works</description>

      <description>Example two: A new Forms response is submitted then Flow promts for an approval request before a new record is created in Vendors table In the last example, we created a simple Flow to create a new Vendor Account from submitted Forms responses. The process was made as simple as it could be: When a new Forms response if submitted, a new Vendor Account will be created on D365FO client.</description>

      <description>With any D365FO users, Data Management workspace and Data Entities should have become one of the most used and well-known tools in the system. We all agree how powerful such integration framework is, especially when it comes to a large number of records that we would need to import into different tables.
The classic method that we have been utilizing is to include all source data in a single (or multiple, much depending on the purpose and order of data integration) Excel sheet, trigger an import execution, pass any validation layers that present and ultimately have the data available on D365FO.</description>
