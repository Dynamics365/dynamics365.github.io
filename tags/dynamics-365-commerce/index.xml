    <description><![CDATA[This post has been written thanks to Joris de Gruyter‘s session in the past DynamicsCon: Azure Devops Automation for Finance and Operations Like You’ve Never Seen! And there’s also been some investigation and (a lot of) trial-and-error from my side until everything has been working.

    <description><![CDATA[Dual-write has been around for almost two years now. It’s one of the ways of integrating Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations and Dataverse along with Virtual Entities.
The standard solution comes with many out-of-the-box entities available to synchronize. This has been one of the great improvements since Dual-write was made available in preview, when Juanan and I demoed it in the 2019 Dynamics Saturday in Madrid.

    <description><![CDATA[A new article for you the community. More specifically, all project managers, functional and technical consultants, as well as customer-side decision-makers on the deployment of Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations.
I told myself that it would be important to offer you a global article on all the testing capabilities (manual or automatic) for Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations. It is the result of quite a long work but which I hope will help you to improve your code delivery and upgrade processes.]]></description>
