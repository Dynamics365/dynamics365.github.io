    <description><![CDATA[<p>All main entry points to the UI and reports are access though the menu structure. This is presented in three ways: the left-hand navigation pane, the content area, and the navigation bar (at the top of the client). The menu design is controlled from the Menus node in the AOT.</p>
<p>Each module will have a menu, which is created by adding a menu reference (or shortcut) to the main menu:</p>

</figure>
<p>This matches the list of modules shown in the client&rsquo;s left-hand navigation pane.</p>
<h4 id="create-menu-in-aot">Create Menu in AOT</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open your project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right-click on the <strong>Menus node</strong> and select <strong>New</strong> &gt; <strong>Menu</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rename the menu as <strong>YourMainMeunuName</strong> and open the property sheet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For Porperties of created Menu:</p>
<p>. Enter the <strong>label</strong> and create a label.</p>
<p>. As this menu will be a module with company-specifc information, set the <strong>SetCompany</strong> property to Yes.</p>
<p>. Choose the icons in the <strong>NormalImage</strong> property and set <strong>ImageLocation</strong> to EmbeddedResource.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create <strong>Submenu</strong>, by right-clicking on the menu and navigating to <strong>New | Submenu</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="finally-we-need-to-add-our-menu-as-a-module-to-the-main-menu-which-is-done-as-follows">Finally, we need to add our menu as a module to the main menu, which is done as follows:</h4>

<p>Place the AOT window next to our project window (if required, open the AOT window by pressing Ctrl + D).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scroll down to Menus and expand MainMenu.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right-click on <strong>MainMenu</strong> and navigate to <strong>New &gt; Menu reference</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This opens a new window titled Select: Menus. Locate <strong>your menu</strong> and drag it to <strong>MainMenu</strong>, as shown in the following screenshot (the title changes from Select: Menus to the path of the select node when you click on it):</p>
</li>
</ol>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>We normally create action delete in foreign table to make sure referential integrity in Logic and validation.</p>
<p>The delete action has the following options: <strong>None, Restricted, Cascade, Cascade + Restricted</strong></p>
<h4 id="none">None:</h4>
<p>This has no effect, and effectively disables the delete action. This is useful if you want to specifically state <em>do nothing</em> so that someone else doesn&rsquo;t try to correct what seems to be an omission.</p>
<h4 id="restricted">Restricted:</h4>
<p>This will prevent the record from being deleted if there are records in the related table that match the selected relation. This occurs within the <code>validateDelete</code> table event, which is called by the delete table event.</p>
<h4 id="cascade">Cascade:</h4>
<p>This will delete the record in the related table, based on the relation. Ex: A sales order line is of no use without a sales order. This is an extension of the delete table event.</p>
<h4 id="cascade--restricted">Cascade + Restricted</h4>
<p>This is a little special. In a two-table scenario, it is the same as <em>Restricted</em>. It will stop the record from being deleted if a related record exists. But if the record is being deleted as part of a cascade from a table related to it, the records will be deleted.</p>
