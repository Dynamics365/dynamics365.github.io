    <description><![CDATA[Hello Dynamics &amp; Power Community,
I’m very happy to announce a good news for you the Dynamics365 F&amp;O Community. I’ve got a little gift for you, as part of the new LCS API.
If you were, like me as an AX 2012 or F&amp;O Technical/Architect Consultant, you probably already suffered from not being able to offer customers the ability to automatically refresh your database from one environment to other. Of course, you could do it via scripts, powershell (but really complicated for LCS and F&amp;O : see even impossible), but finally doing it by code actually….]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Dual-write has been around for almost two years now. It’s one of the ways of integrating Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations and Dataverse along with Virtual Entities.
