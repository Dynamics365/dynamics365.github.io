      <description>This post has been written thanks to Joris de Gruyter‘s session in the past DynamicsCon: Azure Devops Automation for Finance and Operations Like You’ve Never Seen! And there’s also been some investigation and (a lot of) trial-and-error from my side until everything has been working.

      <description>Dual-write has been around for almost two years now. It’s one of the ways of integrating Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations and Dataverse along with Virtual Entities.
The standard solution comes with many out-of-the-box entities available to synchronize. This has been one of the great improvements since Dual-write was made available in preview, when Juanan and I demoed it in the 2019 Dynamics Saturday in Madrid.
This is how Dual write really works</description>

      <description>Dynamics 365 for Finance &amp;amp; Operations and Azure DevOps Azure DevOps Azure DevOps will be the service we will use for source control. Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations supports TFVC out of the box as its version-control system.
But Azure DevOps does not only offer a source control tool. Of course, developers will be the most benefited of using it, but from project management to the functional team and customers, everybody can be involved in using Azure DevOps.</description>
