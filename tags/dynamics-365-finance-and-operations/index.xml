      <description>The Microsoft Azure storage emulator is a tool that emulates the Azure Blob, Queue, and Table services for local development purposes. You can test your application against the storage services locally without creating an Azure subscription or incurring any costs. When you&amp;rsquo;re satisfied with how your application is working in the emulator, switch to using an Azure storage account in the cloud.
In Dynamics 365 finance and operations onebox environment, we also use Microsoft Azure Storage Emulator for same purposes.</description>
