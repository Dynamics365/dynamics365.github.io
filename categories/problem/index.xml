    <description><![CDATA[I got this error at version Dynamics 2012 R3 CU9, SQL Server 2014, Windows Server 2012 R2.
Those kind of errors will come when you move report from Dev Server to Live Server, even compilation in DP Class, Query, Contract, table … without any error

    <description><![CDATA[I updated my dynamics Ax development Environment by restoring Database from Production Database . After the restoring the database, when I run any report form Dynamics Ax, all gave error “Only integrated security is supported for AX queries.”
The reporting Services are still working fine.
For this, best way to redeploy them, create a new report folder, open Microsoft Dynamics Ax 2012 Management Shell (make sure you run Powershell as Administrator).]]></description>

Make sure that SQL Server Reporting Services is configured correctly. Verify the Web Service URL and Report Manager URL configuration in the SQL Reporting Services Configuration Manager.
Anyway, The reporting Services are still working fine and i have already granted the AX Admin as System Administrator under site settings, Home folder settings and DynamicsAX folder with “Browser, Content Manager, DynamicsAXBrowser, My Reports, Publisher, Report Builder” roles.]]></description>
