<h3 id="2-access">2. Access</h3>
<p>You can find the financial reporting menu in Dynamics 365 For Operation by visiting <code>General Ledger &gt; Inquiries and reports &gt; Financial reporting</code></p>
<p>Although, there are some privileges and duties relating to this. These report functions are available to users that have their appropriate privileges and duties assigned to them already.</p>
<p>In order to view, edit, and manage reports in Management Reporter you need to add security administrator role to business Users. Besides, if you only need users can run the financial reports then you have to add the appropriate privileges and duties assigned to them.</p>
<p>Before creating and generating financial reports for a legal entity, you must be done set up for that legal entity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fiscal calendar</li>
<li>Ledger</li>
<li>Chart of Accounts</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="3-management-reporter-benefits">3. Management Reporter Benefits</h3>

<p>Some important components I want to mention here:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Report Designer</strong>

<li><strong>Desktop Viewer</strong>
Used to organize and view reports and supporting files. It also stores the report library.</li>
<li><strong>Web Viewer</strong>
Displays Management Reporter reports in a web browser. The Web Viewer does not require an installation of Management Reporter server components.</li>
<li><strong>Report schedules</strong>
A user can schedule a single report or a group of reports to generate regularly.</li>
<li><strong>Management Reporter database</strong>
This SQL database stores the components, known as building blocks, which are used to generate reports. It also stores report definitions and previously generated reports.</li>
<li><strong>Application service</strong>
Controls access to the data provider and provides connectivity to clients.</li>
<li><strong>Process service</strong>
Generates the reports that are created and queued by the Management Reporter client.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-generate-financial-reports">5. Generate financial reports</h3>
<p>We are currently at Financial reports screen as picture below</p>
<p><figure><a class="lightgallery" href="/2017-07-24-management-reporter-in-dynamics-365-for-operation/2017-04-10_11h56_15.png" title="Financial_reports" data-thumbnail="/2017-07-24-management-reporter-in-dynamics-365-for-operation/2017-04-10_11h56_15.png" data-sub-html="<h2>Financial_reports</h2><p>Financial_reports</p>">
        
    </a><figcaption class="image-caption">Financial_reports</figcaption>
    </figure></p>
<p>As you can see there&rsquo;s nowhere on the screen or anything that indicates that there&rsquo;s the Management Reporter available, but if we click this <code>edit</code> button and entering your email account and password. After you log in, it will open the <strong>Report Definitions</strong> Management Reporter window for us.</p>
<p><figure><a class="lightgallery" href="/2017-07-24-management-reporter-in-dynamics-365-for-operation/2017-04-10_11h57_20.png" title="Financial_reports" data-thumbnail="/2017-07-24-management-reporter-in-dynamics-365-for-operation/2017-04-10_11h57_20.png" data-sub-html="<h2>Financial_reports</h2><p>Financial_reports</p>">
        
    </a><figcaption class="image-caption">Financial_reports</figcaption>
    </figure></p>
<p>On the left, here we have a list of all the same reports that we were looking at in AX.
Let&rsquo;s look at <code>the income statement - default report</code>, So I have a couple parameter fields we need to change before we can generate our report. Please prefer below picture</p>
<p><figure><a class="lightgallery" href="/2017-07-24-management-reporter-in-dynamics-365-for-operation/2017-04-10_12h08_53.png" title="Financial_reports" data-thumbnail="/2017-07-24-management-reporter-in-dynamics-365-for-operation/2017-04-10_12h08_53.png" data-sub-html="<h2>Financial_reports</h2><p>Financial_reports</p>">
        
    </a><figcaption class="image-caption">Financial_reports</figcaption>
    </figure></p>
<p>After we click <strong>generate</strong> button, Financial will be generated on current web browser</p>
<p><figure><a class="lightgallery" href="/2017-07-24-management-reporter-in-dynamics-365-for-operation/2017-04-10_12h11_29.png" title="Financial_reports" data-thumbnail="/2017-07-24-management-reporter-in-dynamics-365-for-operation/2017-04-10_12h11_29.png" data-sub-html="<h2>Financial_reports</h2><p>Financial_reports</p>">
        
    </a><figcaption class="image-caption">Financial_reports</figcaption>
    </figure></p>
<p>we can see here by the report date.  So, on our income statement, we have all the usual fields here.  We have total revenues, gross profit, total operating experiences, net operating income and net income. That all is pretty standard and it all looks good.</p>
<h3 id="6-conclusion">6. Conclusion</h3>
<p>Row, Column, Tree, Report definitions work essentially the same as they did in <strong>Dynamics AX 2012</strong>. I can still use row, column, and tree definitions with multiple reports, and options for the Report definition tabs.</p>
<p><figure><a class="lightgallery" href="/2017-07-24-management-reporter-in-dynamics-365-for-operation/2017-04-10_14h57_51.png" title="Financial_reports" data-thumbnail="/2017-07-24-management-reporter-in-dynamics-365-for-operation/2017-04-10_14h57_51.png" data-sub-html="<h2>Financial_reports</h2><p>Financial_reports</p>">
        
    </a><figcaption class="image-caption">Financial_reports</figcaption>
    </figure></p>
<p>Here are some of the functions that are not available in Financial Reporting for Dynamics 365 for Operations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Publishing/distributing reports to SharePoint and/or SharePoint Online locations is not available.</li>
<li>Report Viewer/Library has been removed.</li>
<li>Import data from an Excel file is not available.</li>
<li>XBRL (extensible Business Reporting Language) is no longer available.</li>

</ul>
<p>Nevertheless, with custom reporting structures, ledger accounts, and dimensions mapping, creation and the capabilities to publish reports to multiple channels and formats from the desktop, and embedding transactional and analytical reports into a customizable dashboard, Financial Reporting in Dynamics 365 For Operation is all set to simplify the financial reporting process, providing instant insight into your financials.</p>
