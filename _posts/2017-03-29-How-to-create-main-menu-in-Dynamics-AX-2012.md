All main entry points to the UI and reports are access though the menu structure. This is presented in three ways: the left-hand navigation pane, the content area, and the navigation bar (at the top of the client). The menu design is controlled from the Menus node in the AOT. 

Each module will have a menu, which is created by adding a menu reference (or shortcut) to the main menu:

<figure class='center '>
  <a href="{{site.url}}/assets/imagesposts/reference_menu.png"><img src="{{site.url}}/assets/imagesposts/reference_menu.png" alt=""></a>
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

This matches the list of modules shown in the client's left-hand navigation pane.

#### Create Menu in AOT

1. Open your project.

2. Right-click on the **Menus node** and select **New** > **Menu**.

3. Rename the menu as **YourMainMeunuName** and open the property sheet.

4. For Porperties of created Menu: 

	. Enter the **label** and create a label.
	
	. As this menu will be a module with company-specifc information, set the **SetCompany** property to Yes.
	
	. Choose the icons in the **NormalImage** property and set **ImageLocation** to EmbeddedResource.

5. Create **Submenu**, by right-clicking on the menu and navigating to **New | Submenu**.

#### Finally, we need to add our menu as a module to the main menu, which is done as follows:

1. Place the AOT window next to our project window (if required, open the AOT window by pressing Ctrl + D).

2. Scroll down to Menus and expand MainMenu.

3. Right-click on **MainMenu** and navigate to **New > Menu reference**.

4. This opens a new window titled Select: Menus. Locate **your menu** and drag it to **MainMenu**, as shown in the following screenshot (the title changes from Select: Menus to the path of the select node when you click on it):

<figure class='center '>
  <a href=""><img src="{{site.url}}/assets/imagesposts/mainmenu2.png" alt=""></a>
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

*Note: Do not drag the menu from your project!*

Save AOT and you can check new menu on AX client.
