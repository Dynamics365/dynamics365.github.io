When I try to install Web Services on IIS for Retails POS Component, and I got the problem.

This scenario shouldn't be common in a production environment, but, it is indeed quite common in a VM machine (I'm using virtual machine Hyper-V on Windows 8.1)

`Exception has been thrown by the target of an invocation`

So, the problem is relate to thee AOS Service account, which by default is usually `NT AUTHORITYNETWORK SERVICE` account.

but because of we are running on a Domain Controller Server, we should use any specific Domain account created just for running AOS services, then youâ€™ll success installing Web Services on IIS.

Now please restart services and try again.
