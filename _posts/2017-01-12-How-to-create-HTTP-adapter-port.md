We normally use `NETTCP` adapter for .NET system, It going to very easy to consume by.

As my experience, if we use `NETTCP` adapter for consuming by Java system, we will need add some extension or 3rd party due to binding and mismatch schema and of course client doesnâ€™t want to do that either me.

So, my solution is creating HTTP adapter for Java, you can also use .NET system to consume HTTP adapter without any problems

* In AX, under System administrator > Services and AIF > Web sites, open from a create new record follow information

Name: `DynamicsAXAif60`
Virtual directory share path: `\\YourServerName\MicrosoftDynamicsAXAif60`
URL: `http://YourServerName/MicrosoftDynamicsAXAif60`

* From now on, you can create AIF inbound port with **HTTP adapter**.
