<p>The model store is the portion of the Microsoft Dynamics AX database where all&nbsp;Microsoft Dynamics AX application elements are stored, including&nbsp;customization. <strong>The model store replaces the AOD (application object definition)</strong> files used in previous releases&nbsp;of Microsoft Dynamics AX (I mean from 4.0 to 2009)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Layer and model information are integral parts of the store.</strong> The AOS has access&nbsp;to the model store, handles layer-flattening, and provides model data to all the&nbsp;Microsoft Dynamics AX sub-systems, such as form- and report-rendering and&nbsp;X++ code.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/5228.model elements_2.jpg" style="width:826px;" /></p>
<p>Microsoft Dynamics AX contains sixteen layers. Each layer consists of one or&nbsp;more logical parts called models. A system generated model exists for each layer.</p>
<p>For example, the VAR Model is the system generated model for the VAR layer.&nbsp;You can use the system generated models to install and start working with the&nbsp;base Microsoft Dynamics AX system. You can leverage the capabilities of&nbsp;models, and tools and functionality that support the models, during customization&nbsp;of the Microsoft Dynamics AX application.</p>
<p><strong>In short</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The model store is the portion of the Microsoft Dynamics AX database where all&nbsp;Microsoft Dynamics AX application elements are stored, including&nbsp;customization.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The model store replaces the AOD files used in previous releases&nbsp;of Microsoft Dynamics AX. It can be managed through the AXUtil command&nbsp;line utility, or by using Windows PowerShell.</li>
<li>The baseline model store database holds model store tables for the previous&nbsp;version of metadata. Use it only during an upgrade.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The baseline model store is&nbsp;similar to the old folder in previous releases of Microsoft Dynamics AX.</li>
</ul>
