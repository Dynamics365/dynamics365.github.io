We normally create action delete in foreign table to make sure referential integrity in Logic and validation.

The delete action has the following options: **None, Restricted, Cascade, Cascade + Restricted**

<!-- more -->

#### None:

This has no effect, and effectively disables the delete action. This is useful if you want to specifically state *do nothing* so that someone else doesn't try to correct what seems to be an omission.

#### Restricted:

This will prevent the record from being deleted if there are records in the related table that match the selected relation. This occurs within the `validateDelete` table event, which is called by the delete table event.

#### Cascade:

This will delete the record in the related table, based on the relation. Ex: A sales order line is of no use without a sales order. This is an extension of the delete table event.

#### Cascade + Restricted

This is a little special. In a two-table scenario, it is the same as *Restricted*. It will stop the record from being deleted if a related record exists. But if the record is being deleted as part of a cascade from a table related to it, the records will be deleted.
