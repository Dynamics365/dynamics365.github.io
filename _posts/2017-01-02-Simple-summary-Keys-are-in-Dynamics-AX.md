* There is a maximum of one `Primary Key` per table, whereas a table can have several `alternate keys`. The `primary key` is usually the type of key that other tables, called child tables, refer to when a `foreign key` field in those other tables need a relational identifier.

* For new tables the default is a `primary key` based on the `RecId` field , incremented number or a completely meaningless number that is generated by the system `surrogate key`.

* As **The RecId data type**, `surrogate keys` exist on a primary key table. As **The RefRecId ETD**, surrogate foreign keys exist on a foreign key table (Ex: `Party` field is on `CustTable` Table). 

* `Alternate key` can be chosen as the `Replacement Key` of a table that can display on forms instead of a meaningless numeric `primary key` value. Each table can have a maximum of one `replacement key`.

* `Natural key` has meaning to people. A set of fields that uniquely identify a record and would have formed the primary key of the table, if not for the existence of a `surrogate key`.

* Relations represents a `foreign key`.
