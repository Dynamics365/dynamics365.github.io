# Coding philosophy
  * Minimizing the footprint of changes (I know how painful is when merging code from different partners or upgrade or installing hot-fix).
  * Where to make the change (always at the highest level and in this order: class, table, form data source field/method, form control).
  * Using field groups (The reason this reduces footprint).
  * Upgrades and system maintainability.
  * Design for a service-oriented architecture.
  * Design for code reuse.
  * Apply Dynamics 365 design patterns and coding best practices.
