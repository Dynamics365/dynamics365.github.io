      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ll find this post in your _posts directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run jekyll serve, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.
To add new posts, simply add a file in the _posts directory that follows the convention YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.</description>

      <description>This post has been written thanks to Joris de Gruyter‘s session in the past DynamicsCon: Azure Devops Automation for Finance and Operations Like You’ve Never Seen! And there’s also been some investigation and (a lot of) trial-and-error from my side until everything has been working.

      <description>Dual-write has been around for almost two years now. It’s one of the ways of integrating Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations and Dataverse along with Virtual Entities.
The standard solution comes with many out-of-the-box entities available to synchronize. This has been one of the great improvements since Dual-write was made available in preview, when Juanan and I demoed it in the 2019 Dynamics Saturday in Madrid.
This is how Dual write really works</description>

      <description>Dynamics 365 for Finance &amp;amp; Operations and Azure DevOps 0.1.1. Azure DevOps Azure DevOps will be the service we will use for source control. Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations supports TFVC out of the box as its version-control system.
But Azure DevOps does not only offer a source control tool. Of course, developers will be the most benefited of using it, but from project management to the functional team and customers, everybody can be involved in using Azure DevOps.</description>

      <description>Hello Dynamics &amp;amp; Power Community,
I’m very happy to announce a good news for you the Dynamics365 F&amp;amp;O Community. I’ve got a little gift for you, as part of the new LCS API.
If you were, like me as an AX 2012 or F&amp;amp;O Technical/Architect Consultant, you probably already suffered from not being able to offer customers the ability to automatically refresh your database from one environment to other. Of course, you could do it via scripts, powershell (but really complicated for LCS and F&amp;amp;O : see even impossible), but finally doing it by code actually….</description>

      <description>Abbott: Strange as it may seem, they give ball players nowadays very peculiar names.
Costello: Funny names?
Abbott: Nicknames, nicknames. Now, on the St. Louis team we have Who&amp;rsquo;s on first, What&amp;rsquo;s on second, I Don&amp;rsquo;t Know is on third&amp;ndash;
Costello: That&amp;rsquo;s what I want to find out. I want you to tell me the names of the fellows on the St. Louis team.
Abbott: I&amp;rsquo;m telling you. Who&amp;rsquo;s on first, What&amp;rsquo;s on second, I Don&amp;rsquo;t Know is on third&amp;ndash;</description>

      <description>This theme supports link posts, made famous by John Gruber. To use, just add link: http://url-you-want-linked to the post&amp;rsquo;s YAML front matter and you&amp;rsquo;re done.
 And this is how a quote looks.
 Some link can also be shown.</description>

All children, except one, grow up. They soon know that they will grow up, and the way Wendy knew was this. One day when she was two years old she was playing in a garden, and she plucked another flower and ran with it to her mother. I suppose she must have looked rather delightful, for Mrs.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;All children, except one, grow up. They soon know that they will grow up, and the way Wendy knew was this. One day when she was two years old she was playing in a garden, and she plucked another flower and ran with it to her mother. I suppose she must have looked rather delightful, for Mrs. Darling put her hand to her heart and cried, &amp;ldquo;Oh, why can&amp;rsquo;t you remain like this for ever!&amp;rdquo; This was all that passed between them on the subject, but henceforth Wendy knew that she must grow up. You always know after you are two. Two is the beginning of the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter when she was tidying up her children&amp;rsquo;s minds. It is the nightly custom of every good mother after her children are asleep to rummage in their minds and put things straight for next morning, repacking into their proper places the many articles that have wandered during the day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
