The following is a comparison of two search engines: lunr: simple, no need to synchronize index.json, no limit for contentLength, but high bandwidth and low performance (Especially for Chinese which needs a large segmentit library) algolia: high performance and low bandwidth, but need to synchronize index.json and limit for contentLength The content of the post is separated by h2 and h3 HTML tag to improve query performance and basically implement full-text search. contentLength is used to limit the max index length of the part starting with h2 and h3 HTML tag. Tips about algolia You need to upload index.json files to algolia to activate searching. You could upload the index.json files by browsers but a CLI tool may be better. Algolia Atomic is a good choice.

You can reference page resources by the value for Resources.GetMatch or the filepath of the resource relative to the page directory directly. Store resources in the assets directory, which is /assets by default. The filepath of the resource to reference in the post is relative to the assets directory. Store resources in the static directory, which is /static by default. The filepath of the resource to reference in the post is relative to the static directory. The priority of references is also in the above order.

Note This article is a shameful copy of the great Grav original page. If you want to know about the extented Markdown syntax, please read extended Markdown syntax page. Let’s face it: Writing content for the Web is tiresome. WYSIWYG editors help alleviate this task, but they generally result in horrible code, or worse yet, ugly web pages. Markdown is a better way to write HTML, without all the complexities and ugliness that usually accompanies it. Some of the key benefits are: Markdown is simple to learn, with minimal extra characters, so it’s also quicker to write content. Less chance of errors when writing in Markdown. Produces valid XHTML output. Keeps the content and the visual display separate, so you cannot mess up the look of your site. Write in any text editor or Markdown application you like. Markdown is a joy to use! John Gruber, the author of Markdown, puts it like this: The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters, the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email. – John Gruber Without further delay, let us go over the main elements of Markdown and what the resulting HTML looks like!

Requirement sets can be specific to Office hosts, such as an ExcelApi 1.7 set, or common to multiple hosts, such as the Dialog API. Requirement set support varies by Office host and host version.

You put your add-in code in this method, and it gets called once the Office.js library has initialized. Inside the onReady() method, you can determine which host your add-in is running in by checking the Office.HostType enum value (for example, Excel or Word). You can check which platform your add-in is running on with an Office.PlatformType enum value (for example, PC or Mac). If you’re using additional JavaScript frameworks that include their own initialization handler or tests, they should be placed within the response to Office.onReady(). For example, you would reference JQuery’s $(document).ready() function as shown in the following code example. Office.onReady(function() { // Office is ready. $(document).ready(function () { // The document is ready. }); }); ","date":"October 8, 2021","objectID":"/2021-10-07-extend-microsoft-365/:6:2","tags":["Microsoft 365"],"title":"Extend Microsoft 365 with office add-ins","uri":"/2021-10-07-extend-microsoft-365/"},{"categories":["Microsoft 365"],"content":"2.1.3. Making asynchronous calls using proxy objects When you work with a document, requested read or write actions are batched up using a proxy object. Your API calls don’t actually read or update the underlying document until you call the sync() method. For better security, your add-in runs in a sandboxed JavaScript environment that can’t directly access the document, or other add-ins. The Office add-ins platform provides a RequestContext object that in turn provides proxy objects to represent the document (such as worksheets, ranges, and tables). The RequestContext is typically passed to your code as a parameter named context. You can use the context object to get any proxy objects you need to work with the document. Before you can read the properties of a proxy object, you must load the properties to populate the proxy object with data from the Office document. You do this by calling the load() method on the proxy object for any properties you need. Then call the context.sync() method, which will load all of the requested properties. For example, if you create a proxy range object to work with a user-selected range in an Excel worksheet, and then want to read the selected range’s address property, you need to load the address property before you can read it. To request properties of a proxy object to be loaded, call the load() method on the object and specify the properties to load. The following example shows a function that defines a local proxy object (selectedRange), loads the address property of that object, then calls context.sync(). When the promise from context.sync() is resolved, the code can then read the address property. Excel.run is required for this specific host, to load properties that affect platform behavior when the function runs. Not all hosts contain a run call. Excel.run(function (context) { var selectedRange = context.workbook.getSelectedRange(); selectedRange.load('address'); return context.sync() .then(function () { console.log('The selected range is: ' + selectedRange.address); }); }).catch(function (error) { console.log('error: ' + error); if (error instanceof OfficeExtension.Error) { console.log('Debug info: ' + JSON.stringify(error.debugInfo)); } }); ","date":"October 8, 2021","objectID":"/2021-10-07-extend-microsoft-365/:6:3","tags":["Microsoft 365"],"title":"Extend Microsoft 365 with office add-ins","uri":"/2021-10-07-extend-microsoft-365/"},{"categories":["Microsoft 365"],"content":"2.2.

A few examples include the server that hosts the add-in, your internal network, or elsewhere in the cloud. If that information is protected, your add-in needs a way to authenticate your user. Outlook add-ins provide a number of different methods to authenticate, depending on your specific scenario.

OAuth2 access tokens Needs access to a third-party service outside of your control. Callback tokens Needs access to the user’s mailbox from your server. 2.4.2.2. Contextual add-ins Contextual add-ins are Outlook add-ins that activate based on text in a message or appointment. You may have seen the default contextual add-ins in Outlook, such as Bing Maps or Suggested Meetings. Using contextual add-ins, a user can initiate tasks related to a message without leaving the message itself, which results in an easier and richer user experience. User chooses… Contextual add-in action Address Open a map of the location. String Open a meeting suggestion add-in. Phone number Add number to your contacts. Contextual add-ins are not currently available in Outlook on Android and iOS at this time. The following image shows a contextual add-in displayed in Outlook. A contextual add-in’s manifest must include an ExtensionPoint element with an xsi:type attribute set to DetectedEntity. Within the ExtensionPoint element, the add-in specifies the entities or regular expression that can activate it. If an entity is specified, the entity can be any of the properties in the Entities object. As such, the add-in manifest must contain a rule of type ItemHasKnownEntity or ItemHasRegularExpressionMatch. The following example shows how to specify that an add-in should activate on messages when it detects a phone number. \u003cExtensionPoint xsi:type=\"DetectedEntity\"\u003e \u003cLabel resid=\"contextLabel\" /\u003e \u003cSourceLocation resid=\"detectedEntityURL\" /\u003e \u003cRule xsi:type=\"RuleCollection\" Mode=\"And\"\u003e \u003cRule xsi:type=\"ItemIs\" ItemType=\"Message\" /\u003e \u003cRule xsi:type=\"ItemHasKnownEntity\" EntityType=\"PhoneNumber\" Highlight=\"all\" /\u003e \u003c/Rule\u003e \u003c/ExtensionPoint\u003e After a contextual add-in is associated with an account, it will automatically start when the user clicks a highlighted entity or regular expression. A user launches a contextual add-in through text, either a known entity or a developer’s regular expression. Typically, a user identifies a contextual add-in because the entity is highlighted. 2.4.2.3. Module add-ins Module add-ins appear in the Outlook navigation bar, right alongside mail, tasks, and calendars. You can use all of the features of the Outlook JavaScript API in your add-in, and create command buttons in the Outlook ribbon so the user can interact with the add-in content. Module add-ins are only supported in Outlook 2016 or later on Windows. The following image shows an example of a module extension add-in.

Key scenarios You can apply simple formatting to an entire existing document using the Office.js APIs. However, if you wish to apply complex formatting or use rich content objects, you can use Office Open XML (OOXML) to create these effects. Examples of capabilities in OOXML include applying drop shadows to text or pictures, coercing text boxes into shapes, and inserting Excel charts as live charts in Word documents. Because this is a more advanced skill, we will not cover this subject in its entirety but mention it for developers who are familiar with OOXML. 2.5.2.1. Working with document text Word add-ins use the Office.onReady() event handler to start. If the add-in targets Word 2016 or later, it calls the Word.run() method to run Word JavaScript APIs. The add-in must pass a function to Word.run() that expects a context object to be passed as the parameter. The context object allows the add-in to interact with the Word document. You can use the context object to create any needed proxy objects for the Word document and load the proxies with any properties you wish to use. You can also program actions to run using those properties. As always, a context.sync() command then synchronizes the state between the proxy objects and objects in the Word document. The following example shows code that inserts text after the body text of a Word document. For simplicity, this sample omits the Office.onReady() code and focuses on the code within a Word.run() code block. // Run a batch operation against the Word JavaScript API. Word.run(function (context) { // Create a proxy object for the document body. var body = context.document.body; // Queue a command to load the text property of the proxy body object. body.load(\"text\"); // Queue a command to insert text into the end of the Word document body. body.insertText('This is text inserted after loading the body.text property', Word.InsertLocation.end); // Synchronize the document state by executing the queued commands, // and return a promise to indicate task completion. return context.sync().then(function () { console.log(\"Body contents: \" + body.text); }); }) 2.5.2.2. Search You can use the APIs to search the document for text that meets your criteria. You can also scope your search to certain types of content, for example, paragraphs or tables. The following code sample searches for the text “video you” and ignores punctuation. If the text is found, the matches are bolded, highlighted in yellow, and the font color set to purple. // Run a batch operation against the Word object model. Word.run(function (context) { // Queue a command to search the document and ignore punctuation. var searchResults = context.document.body.search('video you', {ignorePunct: true}); // Queue a command to load the search results and get the font property values. context.load(searchResults, 'font'); // Synchronize the document state by executing the queued commands, // and return a promise to indicate task completion. return context.sync().then(function () { console.log('Found count: ' + searchResults.items.length); // Queue a set of commands to change the font for each found item. for (var i = 0; i \u003c searchResults.items.length; i++) { searchResults.items[i].font.color = 'purple'; searchResults.items[i].font.highlightColor = '#FFFF00'; //Yellow searchResults.items[i].font.bold = true; } // Synchronize the document state by executing the queued commands, // and return a promise to indicate task completion. return context.sync(); }); }) .catch(function (error) { console.log('Error: ' + JSON.stringify(error)); if (error instanceof OfficeExtension.Error) { console.log('Debug info: ' + JSON.stringify(error.debugInfo)); } }); ","date":"October 8, 2021","objectID":"/2021-10-07-extend-microsoft-365/:10:2","tags":["Microsoft 365"],"title":"Extend Microsoft 365 with office add-ins","uri":"/2021-10-07-extend-microsoft-365/"},{"categories":["Microsoft 365"],"content":"2.5.3.

Understand the capabilities of custom functions Custom functions have several unique capabilities and restrictions because they run in a separate runtime from other add-in interactions, like task panes.

Custom function capabilities You can create custom JavaScript or TypeScript functions that can be accessed like built-in Excel functions such as SUM(). You can also create streaming custom functions, which return a value based on a timer. For example, you can update the current time value in a cell every second. You can make network calls from custom functions as well. The following code sample defines the custom function add that accepts two numbers then returns their sum. /** * Adds two numbers. * @customfunction * @param first First number. * @param second Second number. * @returns The sum of the two numbers. */ function add(first, second){ return first + second; } JSDoc code comment descriptions The JSDoc tags in the code comments are used to generate a JSON metadata file that describes the custom function to Excel. The JSON metadata file enables Excel to accurately present information to a user and pass expected parameters to your custom function. @customfunction: Is declared first and indicates it’s a custom function. Required. @param: Describes the parameter. Include for each parameter defined by the function. @returns: Describes what the function outputs. The comment description “Adds two numbers.” is also added to the JSON Metadata file for Excel to display when the user is viewing your custom function.

Custom function runtime restrictions The custom function runtime only runs JavaScript. There’s no document object model (DOM) or local storage, as you would find in a browser-based JavaScript runtime environment. This means you can’t load any libraries that use the DOM, such as jQuery. Also, you can’t access the Office.js API to interact with the document like you can from a task pane. Instead, the custom functions runtime is optimized for tasks such as performing rapid calculations and generally doesn’t need to use some of the Office.js APIs such as formatting tools in Excel. Custom functions have a webpage that loads the custom functions runtime. Since the custom functions runtime doesn’t have a UI, there’s nothing for the webpage to display. You’ll find the following script tag in the webpage that loads the library for the custom functions runtime. \u003cscript src=\"https://appsforoffice.microsoft.com/lib/1/hosted/custom-functions-runtime.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e Typically custom functions are combined with a task pane in the same add-in. If you create your add-in project using the Yeoman generator for Office add-ins, the project will have a webpage for the custom functions, and a web page with UI for the task pane.

Using storage API to communicate with the task pane Custom function code and task pane code (which uses Office.js) can’t call or communicate directly with each other. But you can use a storage API that allows them to share data. A common scenario for using the storage API is when the add-in needs to share a security token for accessing a secure network resource. The user might first call a custom function that requires them to be signed in. After authentication, it receives the security token. Then it shares the security token using the storage API so that later, when the user opens the task pane, the task pane doesn’t need to sign them in again. Alternatively, the user might open the task pane first. In this case, the task pane will sign in the user and share the security token through the storage API. When a custom function is used later, the custom function can get the security token through the storage API. 2.6.3.1. Storage API example /** * @customfunction * @description Stores a value in OfficeRuntime.storage. * @param {any} key Key in the key-value pair you will store. * @param {any} value Value in the key-value pair you will store. */ function storeValue(key, value) { return OfficeRuntime.storage.setItem(key, value).then(function (result) { return \"Success: Item with key '\" + key + \"' saved to storage.\"; }, function (error) { return \"Error: Unable to save item with key '\" + key + \"' to storage. \" + error; }); } /** * @customfunction * @description Gets value from OfficeRuntime.storage. * @param {any} key Key of item you intend to get. */ function getValue(key) { return OfficeRuntime.storage.getItem(key); } ","date":"October 8, 2021","objectID":"/2021-10-07-extend-microsoft-365/:11:3","tags":["Microsoft 365"],"title":"Extend Microsoft 365 with office add-ins","uri":"/2021-10-07-extend-microsoft-365/"},{"categories":["Microsoft 365"],"content":"2.6.4.

How to authorize to Microsoft Graph Authentication The add-in can get an access token from Azure Active Directory (AAD) when the user has signed in. AAD doesn’t allow its sign-in page to open in an iframe, and the add-in task pane is an iframe when the add-in is launched in Office on the Web. So, use the Office JavaScript Dialog API to display the AAD login form. If your add-in includes custom functions that need authorization to Microsoft Graph, use the custom functions Dialog API to display the login form. Authorization After the user signs in, your add-in gets an access token to use in subsequent API calls to Microsoft Graph. The access token can never give the add-in more or greater permissions than the user has. Users typically only have permissions to data about themselves, their own files and email, and objects that have been shared with them. If your add-in gets Microsoft Graph data about multiple users, then it can be used successfully only by users with admin-level permissions. Recommended libraries Depending on your development choices, you can use one of the following libraries for authentication and authorization as appropriate. Your server-side is on a .NET-based framework (for example, .NET Core or ASP.NET): use MSAL.NET Your server-side is node.js-based: use Passport Azure AD Your add-in uses Implicit flow: use msal.js 4.

Thanks for your business\"; } //following 3rd example of an OData action takes in a parameter and returns a list [SysODataActionAttribute(\"GetColors\", true), SysODataCollectionAttribute(\"return\", Types::Record, \"CarColor\")] public List GetColorsByAvailability(boolean onlyAvailableVehicles) { List returnList = new List(Types::Record); // do something return returnList; } } In this example, the SysODataActionAttribute class decorates the assginUserToCompany method that is exposed as an action. The first argument of the attribute is the publicly exposed name of the action, and the second argument indicates whether this action need an entity instance or not. If you set the second argument to false, the method has to be static. You might need reset IIS service to update Odata endpoint. 2.

This class takes in three parameters: The name of the parameter that is a list (Use return for the return value of the method.). The X++ type of the members of this list. The public name of the OData resource that is contained in the collection.

I’ve got a little gift for you, as part of the new LCS API. If you were, like me as an AX 2012 or F\u0026O Technical/Architect Consultant, you probably already suffered from not being able to offer customers the ability to automatically refresh your database from one environment to other. Of course, you could do it via scripts, powershell (but really complicated for LCS and F\u0026O : see even impossible), but finally doing it by code actually…. and here I will show you the benefit of the PowerAutomate / Flow to refresh automatically your F\u0026O production instance to an UAT instance, without any line of code ! I will provide you, the How-To setup here in this article (step-by-step), also 3 samples of my GitHub account for PowerAutomate flow. Hope you will like it, and feel free to share it :) So…. how to start :) First of all, here is a quick summary of the new API for LCS - in Dynamics 365 F\u0026O. Like you know, we were not able to perform automatic Database movement in the past. We get only to an Azure Marketplace a flow between Azure DevOps release pipeline in order to upload your BUILD package and also setup an automatic deployment. It was the very beginning to perform great automatic release pipelines : like me, deploying every night for customers a recent package in our TEST environments every night after BUILD completed. Database movement operations are a suite of self-service actions that can be used as part of Data Application Lifecycle Management (also referred to as DataALM). These actions provide structured processes for common implementation scenarios such as golden configuration promotion, debugging/diagnostics, destructive testing, and general refresh for training purposes. In this topic, you will learn how to use database movement operations to perform refresh, export, import, and various flavors of point-in-time restore. At the time, I write this article, the LCS API have only 4 methods but I hope Microsoft will add soon more methods and of course I will share that with you depending on which and when it will be possible. We can perform the following operations through the RESTful API: List DB backups for an LCS project. Create a DB refresh between two environments (only Prod and Sandbox environments, like we can do in LCS). Get an ongoing operation status. Quick feedbacks for Microsoft : we really need to add also monitoring KPI stuff methods in order to get the DTU SQL Percentage Live for production or other stuff like that, in order to not connect every time in the LCS Portal and check if everything looks good : to be proactive in fact / and maybe also restart service etc… : but yep I maybe ask a lot, it’s a good start now that this API is open, so I know that Microsoft will bring this API even better this year ! Microsoft Documentation - LCS API First, you will need to create an Azure AAD in order to connect to the LCS API. You can go here for the How-To setup : https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/database/api/dbmovement-api-authentication Don’t forget to copy somewhere your ClientID : ApplicationID and also to generate a ClientSecret. Also don’t forget to put the Dynamics Lifecycle Services like below as a Delegated access, with Grant Admin permission. So, now you have the access to call the LCS API, and you can authenticate to it. But maybe, like me, if you had in the past configure the AzureDevOps release pipeline process to connect to LCS, you had maybe already an App Registration in your Azure AD, so you can keep it and reuse for this purpose. Just for your information, It was not possible to create directly for you Custom Connectors in PowerAutomate in order to deploy it more easily. Since the LCS API use at the moment a strange and old school authentification. Hope I can share that when OAuth 2.0 will be used for this API !). But these samples will be enough and easy to co","date":"May 5, 2021","objectID":"/2021-05-05-lcs-api-database-movement-with-powerautomate/:0:0","tags":["Dynamics 365 Finance \u0026 Operatiom","PowerAutomate","ALM","LCS API","Database Movement"],"title":"LCS API Database Movement with PowerAutomate","uri":"/2021-05-05-lcs-api-database-movement-with-powerautomate/"},{"categories":null,"content":"1. PowerAutomate Sample - LCS API - Automatic refresh database If you go in, I will explain step-by-step in order to configure it and also give inputs why I’ve done that :) Click on “EDIT” button. Here is below the whole flow, without any line of code :) So, first step, since it’s a scheduled flow in my example, I can setup when my flow will run. Here I have put every weedays at 7 p.m but sure you can edit it of course. Keep in mind, that you can of course do it by a trigger from other connector in PowerAutomate. Like maybe do it after an Azure DevOps Pipeline is finished or after a BUILD process, after also an approval by someone else in Microsoft Teams in adaptive card, by a click in a button in a PowerApps : well, I can give 150 examples so you can setup like you want ! Just be careful also on the interval, you can setup only 3 refresh in a day for 1 target environment ! (limitation by LCS) After I just create a variable to put your LCS project ID. Of course, change the value in it to reflect your current LCS project. You can grab it directly in your LCS portal if you don’t know it After, I use the HTTP connector to perform the authentification with of course your Azure Application ID and Secret token that you have created earlier. You will need here only to change the values of : username, password, clientid and clientsecret. Keep the resource and grant_type like this, as it is. Don’t change the Content-Type of the header. One more thing : don’t use an LCS account that of course doesn’t have access and have appropriate security role. And like me, don’t use an account that has a MFA account (Multi Factor Authentification), use like an administrator/service account. After I just use the Parse JSON feature, in order to get the object of the response. The most important thing is the property : Access_Token It will be used after for every call to the LCS API, in the header, you will see :) Keep in mind that the Token is for 1 hour of expiration !! So don’t forget to refresh your call to authenticate after 1 hour if you need to ! After I have created 2 more variables : the source \u0026 target environment of your LCS environments that you want to refresh database. Of course, change by your need ! As a reminder, you can get the Environment ID by going in more details of LCS. Finally I call the LCS API to refresh the database, like this : Here you don’t have to change anything, good right ? :) But, I want to explain the Authorization header. It’s here that we put the Access_Token of the response after authentification. It’s like : Bearer xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx_veryhugemassive_token The space key is mandatory, so don’t forget it ! Of course at the end, I add it also a Parse JSON to build the object response of the API. After, I added a conditional split. Of course, the purpose is to achieve a different path in the Flow, if the response is OK or not… In my “not success path”, I just put a Push Mobile Notification Action, but it’s just an example of course. You can change it by whatever you like. Don’t forget you have now more than 300 connectors in PowerAutomate (Microsoft and other third-party apps !) On my “success path”, here is for me the most important feature ! First step here, I wait for 1 hour, magic no ? but why ? Well because, we don’t have to call LCS API to fetch the status of the current activity of the database refresh until more than 1 hour. Like me, it takes 1hour30min and sometimes maybe 2 hours to finish all the refresh. But you change it of course by adding just 30 minutes of wait if you had experience faster refresh on your side ! It’s also for me a good example to show you that we can put Expression without to be a massive developper ! After I’ve done a Do Until feature, in order to call every 5 minutes the LCS API to fetch the status. In order to after doing some actions in the same flow. The end of my “while'“ loop is until we’ve got a Status Operation than is not equal to : In Progress.

LCS API - Export database You already know that we can export database also on the LCS Portal by manual action on a Sandbox instance. Of course, it can be good to do it like just after our previous sample because we have done a flow (DataALM) to refresh the production to an UAT instance. If you want to get the .bacpac (backup of SQL Azure) in order to deploy it (implied your production database) to a DEV environment. Maybe also because you want to archive it to a safe repository. So yes, the LCS API has already a method for that, that’s why I made this sample for you. I assume that you have already download it from my GitHub Account before and already import it like the previous one. Go in this flow. I will not explain again this part, because it’s exactly the same as the Database Refresh. After, I made 2 variables : the backupName wanted and also the environmentId that you want to export the database. After, I call the LCS API and grab the response to a JSON object.

Retrieve list of database backup Here, we will have the possibility to retrieve the list of the whole backup list in your LCS Asset Library. As you know, it’s the default storage, where all database backup are coming. At the end I’ve done a For Each feature, good way to show you this point ! Well… sad news : true. Because I try to add also an another HTTP Connector for the FileLocation (it’s the HTTP location where you can download your backup) but the limitation is for 100MB so you will get like me an error. My aim was after to grab the fileContent to a OneDrive, Google Drive, Sharepoint or Azure Blob Storage, but yes… at this time we can’t. The only way that I have for you, is to do it by a more complicated way. You can create a powershell script in your own network / share folder (onPremise). You can after download the Data Gateway for PowerAutomate in order to call your script, passing through the FileLocation and your Powershell will download it on your onPremise folder. Yes I didn’t talk about that, but yes we can achieve a connection from PowerAutomate (SaaS - Cloud Only) to connect on an onPremise API - Service. PowerAutomate - Data Gateway onPremise PowerAutomate - Powershell onPremise To conclude : I hope you like it :) Besides that, feel free to contact me, comment, do feedbacks etc… You can see easily that PowerAutomate in part of the PowerPlatform is really a huge feature that will help us in a lot of flows for F\u0026O project. Because despite this technical part of DataALM, like I’ve done for other articles in this blog, we can achieve a lot more of use cases now ! Business cases , Business Events etc… See you !

I think this is the interesting comparison. How did a Tier-1 MS-hosted build VM cost? Around 400€? How does it compare to using the Azure DevTest Labs alternative? There’s only one fix cost when using Azure DevTest Labs: the blob storage where the VHD is uploaded. The VHD’s size is around 130GB and this should have a cost of, more or less, 5 euros/month. Keep in mind that you need to clean up your custom images when yours is prepared, the new ones are created as snapshots and also take space in the storage account. Then we have the variable costs that come with the deployment of a VM each build but it’s just absurd. Imagine we’re using a B4ms VM, with a 256GB Premium SSD disk, we would pay 0.18€/hour for the VM plus the proportional part of 35.26€/month of the SSD disk, which would be like 5 cents/hour? But this can run on a B2ms VM too which is half the compute price of the VM, down to 9 cents per hour. If we run this build once a day each month, 30 times, the cost of a B4ms would be like… 7€? Add the blob storage and we’ll be paying 12€ per month to run our builds with DB sync and tests. Is it cheaper than deploying a cloud-hosted environment, and starting and stopping it using the new d365fo.tools Cmdlets each time we run the build? Yes it is! Because if we deploy a CHE we’ll be paying the price of the SSD disk for the whole month!

We’re not X++ only developers anymore, we’re very lucky to be working on a product that is using Azure. I’m sure there’s scenarios where using DevTest Labs to create a build VM is useful. Maybe not for an implementation partner, but maybe it is for an ISV partner. It’s just an additional option. The only bad thing to me is that we need to apply the version upgrades manually to the VHDs because they’re published only twice a year.

Your customers need to invite you to their project. If you’re an ISV you can use the “Migrate, create solutions, and learn” projects. In any of both cases you need to go to “Project settings” and select the “Visual Studio Team Services” Tab. Scroll down and you should see two fields. Fill the field with your DevOps URL without the project part.

MSDyn365FO has taken us to uncharted territory, so it is not uncommon for different teams to work in different ways, depending on their experience and what they’ve found in the path.

Branching strategies I want to make it clear in advance: I’m not an expert in managing code nor Azure DevOps, at all. All that I’ve written here is product of my experience (good and bad) of over 4 years working with Finance and Operations. In this article on branching strategies from the docs there’s more information regarding branching and links to articles of the DevOps team. And there’s even more info in the DevOps Rangers’ Library of tooling and guidance solutions! 0.1.6.1. Main-Release One possible strategy is using a Main and a Release branch. We have already learnt that the Main branch is created when the Build VM is deployed. The usual is that in an implementation project all development will be done on that branch until the Go Live, and just before that a new Release branch will be created. We will keep development work on the Main branch, and when that passes validation, we’ll move it to Release. This branching strategy is really simple and will keep us mostly worry-free. 0.1.6.2. Dev – Main – Release This strategy is similar to the Main – Release one but includes a Dev branch for each developer. This dev branch must be maintained by the developer using it. He can do as many check-ins as he wants during a development, and when it’s done merge all these changes to the Main branch in a single changeset. Of course, this adds some bureaucracy because we also need to forward integrate changes from Main into our Dev branch, but it will allow us to have a cleaner list of changesets when merging them from Main to the Release branch. Whatever branching strategy you choose try to avoid having pending changesets to be merged for a long time. The amount of merge conflicts that will appear is directly proportional to the time the changeset has been waiting to be merged. I wrote all of this based on my experience. It’s obviously not the same working for an ISV than for an implementation partner. An ISV has different needs, it must maintain different code versions to support all their customers and they don’t necessarily need to work in a Main – Release manner. They could have one (or more) branch for each version. However, since the end of overlayering this is not necessary. More ideas about this can be found in the article linked at the beginning.

We can also create new build definitions from scratch, however it’s easier to clone the default one and modify it to other branches or needs.

Gated check-ins A gated check-in is a bit different than a CI build. The gated check-in will trigger an automated build BEFORE checking-in the code. If it fails, the changeset is not cheked-in until the errors are fixed and checked-in again. This option might seem perfect for the merge check-ins to the Main branch. I’ve found some issues trying to use it, for example: If multiple merges \u0026 check-ins from the same development are done and the first fails but the second doesn’t, you’ll still have pending merges to be done. You can try batching the builds, but I haven’t tried that. Issues with error notifications and pending code on dev VMs. If many check-ins are made, you’ll end up with lots of queued builds (and we only have one available agent per DevOps project). This can also be solved using the “Batch changes while a build is in progress”. I think the CI option is working perfectly to validate code. As I’ve already said several times, choose the strategy that better suits your team and your needs. Experiment with CI and Gated check-in builds and decide what is better for you.

Azure agents With the capacity to run an extra Azure-hosted build we get another agent to run a pipeline and can run multiple pipelines at the same time.

Just go to LCS, click on the “Generate SAS link” button for each file, use it as the source parameter in the command and your blob SAS URL as the destination one. Once you have all the files in your blob you can download them to your local PC at a good speed. Once you’ve unzipped the VHD you need to change it from Dynamic to Fixed using this PowerShell command: Convert-VHD –Path VHDLOCATION.vhd –DestinationPath NEWVHD.vhd –VHDType Fixed The reason is you can’t create an Azure VM from a dynamically-sized VHD.

Creating the VM We’ve got the essential, a VHD ready to be used as a base to create a virtual machine in Azure. Our next step is finding a way to make the deployment of this VM predictable and automated. We will attain this thanks to Azure ARM templates. Go back to your DevTest Labs overview page and click the “Add” button, on the “Choose base” page select the base you’ve just created, and on the next screen click on the “Add or Remove Artifacts” link: MSDyn365 \u0026 Azure DevOps ALM 49Add artifacts to the VM \" MSDyn365 \u0026 Azure DevOps ALM 49 Add artifacts to the VM Search for WinRM, select “Configure WinRM”, and on the next screen enter “Shared IP address” as the hostname box and click “Add”. Note: if when the VM runs the artifacts can’t be installed check whether the Azure VM Agent is installed on the base VHD. Thanks to Joris for pointing this out! 0.4.5.1. Configure Azure DevOps Agent Service 0.4.5.1.1. Option A: use an artifact Update: thanks to Florian Hopfner for reminding me this because I forgot… If you choose Option A to install the agent service you need to do some things first! The first thing we need to do is running some PowerShell scripts that create registry entries and environment variables in the VM, go to C:\\DynamicsSDK and run these: Import-Module $(Join-Path \\-Path \"C:\\\\DynamicsSDK\" \\-ChildPath \"DynamicsSDKCommon.psm1\") \\-Function \"Write-Message\", \"Set-AX7SdkRegistryValues\", \"Set-AX7SdkEnvironmentVariables\" Set\\-AX7SdkEnvironmentVariables \\-DynamicsSDK \"C:\\\\DynamicsSDK\" Set\\-AX7SdkRegistryValues \\-DynamicsSDK \"c:\\\\DynamicsSDK\" \\-TeamFoundationServerUrl \"https://dev.azure.com/YOUR\\_ORG\" \\-AosWebsiteName $AosWebsiteName \"AosService\" The first one will load the functions and make them available in the command-line and the other two create the registry entries and environment variables. Now we need to add an artifact for the Azure DevOps agent service. This will configure the agent service on the VM each time the VM is deployed. Search for “Azure Pipelines Agent” and click it. You will see this: MSDyn365 \u0026 Azure DevOps ALM 50DevTest Labs Azure DevOps Agent \" MSDyn365 \u0026 Azure DevOps ALM 50 DevTest Labs Azure DevOps Agent We need to fill some information: On “Azure DevOps Organization Name” you need to provide the name of your organization. For example if your AZDO URL is https://dev.azure.com/blackbeltcorp you need to use blackbeltcorp. On “AZDO Personal Access Token” you need to provide a token generated from AZDO. On “Agent Name” give your agent a name, like DevTestAgent. And on “Agent Pool” a name for your pool, a new like DevTestPool or an existing one as Default. On “Account Name” use the same user that we’ll use in our pipeline later. Remember this. And on “Account Password” its password. Using secrets with a KeyVault is better, but I won’t explain this here. And, finally, set “Replace Agent” to true. 0.4.5.1.2. Option B: Configure Azure DevOps Agent in the VM To do this you have to create a VM from the base image you created before and then go to C:\\DynamicsSDK and run the SetupBuildAgent script with the needed parameters: SetupBuildAgent.ps1 \\-VSO\\_ProjectCollection \"https://dev.azure.com/YOUR\\_ORG\" \\-ServiceAccountName \"myUser\" \\-ServiceAccountPassword \"mYPassword\" \\-AgentName \"DevTestAgent\" \\-AgentPoolName \"DevTestPool\" \\-VSOAccessToken \"YOUR\\_VSTS\\_TOKEN\" WARNING: If you choose option B you must create a new base image from the VM where you’ve run the script.

Preparing the VM The VHD image you download can be used as a developer VM with no additional work, just run Visual Studio, connect it to your AZDO project and done. But if you want to use it as a build box you need to do several things first. Remember that the default user and password for these VHDs are Administrator and Pass@word1. 0.4.6.1. Disable services First of all we will stop and disable services like the Batch, Management Reporter, SSAS, SSIS, etc. Anything you see that’s not needed to run a build. 0.4.6.2. Create a new SQL user Open SSMS (as an Administrator) and create a new SQL user as a copy of the axdbadmin one. Then open the web.config file and update the DB user and password to use the one you’ve just created. 0.4.6.3. Prepare SSRS (optional) If you want to deploy reports as part of your build pipeline you need to go to SSMS again (and as an Admin again), and open a new query in the reporting DB to execute the following query: execDeleteEncryptedContent 0.4.6.4. PowerShell Scripts The default build definition that runs on a build VM uses several PowerShell scripts to run some tasks. I’m adding an additional script called PrepareForAgent. The scripts can be found in the C:\\DynamicsSDK folder of the VM. 0.4.6.4.1. PrepareForBuild This script comes with the VM and we need to modify it to avoid one thing: the PackagesLocalDirectory backup which is usually done in the first build. We need to get rid of this or we’ll waste around an hour per run until the files are copied. We don’t need this because our VM will be new each time we run the pipeline! So open the script, go to line 696 and look for this piece of code: # Create packages backup (if it does not exist). $NewBackupCreated \\= Backup-AX7Packages \\-BackupPath $PackagesBackupPath \\-DeploymentPackagesPath $DeploymentPackagesPath \\-LogLocation $LogLocation # Restore packages backup (unless a new backup was just created). if (!$NewBackupCreated) { Restore-AX7Packages \\-BackupPath $PackagesBackupPath \\-DeploymentPackagesPath $DeploymentPackagesPath \\-LogLocation $LogLocation \\-RestoreAllFiles:$RestorePackagesAllFiles } if (!$DatabaseBackupToRestore) { $DatabaseBackupPath \\= Get-BackupPath \\-Purpose \"Databases\" Backup-AX7Database \\-BackupPath $DatabaseBackupPath } else { # Restore a database backup (if specified). Restore-AX7Database \\-DatabaseBackupToRestore $DatabaseBackupToRestore } We need to modify it until we end up with this: if ($DatabaseBackupToRestore) { Restore-AX7Database \\-DatabaseBackupToRestore $DatabaseBackupToRestore } We just need the DB restore part and skip the backup, otherwise we’ll be losing 45 minutes in each run for something we don’t need because the VM will be deleted when the build is completed. 0.4.6.5. Optional (but recommended): install d365fo.tools Just run this: Install-Module -Name d365fo.tools We can use the tools to do a module sync, partial sync or deploy just our reports instead of all.

Show me the money! I think this is the interesting comparison. How did a Tier-1 MS-hosted build VM cost? Around 400€? How does it compare to using the Azure DevTest Labs alternative? There’s only one fix cost when using Azure DevTest Labs: the blob storage where the VHD is uploaded. The VHD’s size is around 130GB and this should have a cost of, more or less, 5 euros/month. Keep in mind that you need to clean up your custom images when yours is prepared, the new ones are created as snapshots and also take space in the storage account. Then we have the variable costs that come with the deployment of a VM each build but it’s just absurd. Imagine we’re using a B4ms VM, with a 256GB Premium SSD disk, we would pay 0.18€/hour for the VM plus the proportional part of 35.26€/month of the SSD disk, which would be like 5 cents/hour? But this can run on a B2ms VM too which is half the compute price of the VM, down to 9 cents per hour. If we run this build once a day each month, 30 times, the cost of a B4ms would be like… 7€? Add the blob storage and we’ll be paying 12€ per month to run our builds with DB sync and tests. Is it cheaper than deploying a cloud-hosted environment, and starting and stopping it using the new d365fo.tools Cmdlets each time we run the build? Yes it is! Because if we deploy a CHE we’ll be paying the price of the SSD disk for the whole month!

Some final remarks I have accomplished this mostly through trial-and-error. There’s lots of enhancements and best practices to be applied to all the process, specially using an Azure Key Vault to store all the secrets to be used in the Azure DevOps Agent artifact and the pipeline. This in another clear example that X++ developers need to step outside of X++ and Dynamics 365 FnO. We’re not X++ only developers anymore, we’re very lucky to be working on a product that is using Azure. I’m sure there’s scenarios where using DevTest Labs to create a build VM is useful. Maybe not for an implementation partner, but maybe it is for an ISV partner. It’s just an additional option. The only bad thing to me is that we need to apply the version upgrades manually to the VHDs because they’re published only twice a year. As I said at the beginning of the post, it may have worked to me with all these steps, but if you try you maybe need to change some things. But it’s a good way to start.

Things I don’t like/understand/need to investigate I’ve always done this with a single solution and only one C# project. I have some doubts about how this will work with many C# projects, models, solutions, etc. For example, if a model has a dependency on the DLL but it’s built before the DLL the build will fail. I’m sure there’s a way to set an order to solve dependencies like there is for FnO projects within a solution. Or maybe I could try building all the C#/.NET projects before, pack them in a nuget and use the DLLs later in the FnO build, something similar to what Paul Heisterkamp explained in his blog.

This happens because Tier 2+ environments use Azure SQL as the DB engine and Tier 1 VMs use SQL Server. The time it takes to complete the process depends on the size of the database and the performance of the VM you’ll restore it to. But it’s not a fast process at all. For a 60GB database you’ll get a bacpac around 7GB that will take: 1 to 2 hours to refresh to UAT 2 to 4 hours for the bacpac to be exported At least 4 hours to restore it to a Tier 1 VM. That’s between 7 and 11 hours until you have the DB on a developer machine. Once it’s there you can quickly get a BAK and share it.

My proposal To do the last part of the LCS DB API flow from prod to dev, we need a Tier 1 VM where the bacpac will be restored. My idea is using the build VM on Microsoft’s subscription and an Azure DevOps pipeline to run all the scripts that will restore the DB in that VM. It’s an underused machine and it fits perfectly to this purpose. I want to clarify why I’ve thought about doing this using the build VM. In most cases this VM will be doing nothing during the night, maybe only running some tests, and it’s during that period of time when I suggest doing all this. But be aware that depending on your DB size this won’t be possible or you’ll run out of space after 2 o 3 restores. So think about deploying an extra VM and install an agent there to do this, whatever you do don’t mess with the build VM if you don’t know what you’re doing! Try this on a dev VM or anywhere else if you’re afraid of breaking something. Remember you’ll lose the capacity to generate DPs and run pipelines if this environments breaks! This post is just an example of a possible solution, you need to decide what suits you best! End of the update. As I said before I’ll be using Mötz Jensen‘s d365fo.tools, we could do everything without them but that would be a bit stupid because using the tools is easier, faster and makes everything clearer. I’ve separated all the steps in 3 Powershell scripts: execute the refresh, export the bacpac and restore the bacpac. 2.2.3.1.

Timing These 3 scripts will call the LCS DB API to refresh, export and restore the DB. But there’s the timing issue. Refreshing the database takes some time and exporting it too. You need to find a way to control the status of the operations. The LCS DB API offers an operation you can use to get the status of the ongoing operation. Using d365fo.tools: Get-D365LcsDatabaseRefreshStatus \\-OperationActivityId 123456789 \\-EnvironmentId \"99ac6587-c13b-4ea3-81cd-2d26fa72ec5e\" You can choose to control that inside your Powershell scripts, but if we use the agent on the build VM that means we cannot use it for anything else until everything is done. That’s why I separated the process in 3 steps. You can manually schedule 3 pipelines, one for each step at the times you know each stage ends. Then you can choose the order: export, restore, refresh or refresh, export, restore. You could also use Windows Task Scheduler and forget about AZDO Pipelines, but we’re not doing that because we love pipelines. And that’s all, we finally have a way of moving data without having to do it manually, we can schedule it, but we need to take some decisions on how we’ll do things. And I’ll leave that up to you 🙂 Secure your Azure Pipelines with Azure Key Vault But creating a pipeline with a password in plain sight was not very secure. How could we add extra security to a pipeline? Once again we can turn to an Azure tool to help us, the Azure Key Vault. Azure Key Vault A Key Vault is a service that allows us to safely store certificates or secrets and later use them in our applications and services. And like many other Azure services it has a cost but it’s really low and, for a normal use, you will be billed like a cent or none a month. Don’t be stingy with security! You might already know about Azure Key Vault because we can use it in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations under System Administration. For example it’s how the company certificates for the Spanish SII or Brazilian NF-e are stored and later retrieved to call the web services.

More specifically, all project managers, functional and technical consultants, as well as customer-side decision-makers on the deployment of Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations. I told myself that it would be important to offer you a global article on all the testing capabilities (manual or automatic) for Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations. It is the result of quite a long work but which I hope will help you to improve your code delivery and upgrade processes. As you know, updates to version 10.x are monthly and therefore require operational tests on a regular basis ! I don’t know for you, but for some customers that I know it can take almost 1 week or more for 3 consultants… In addition, if you want to be in an agile process of continuous delivery in production, it is often necessary to take time with the Key Users or the IT team to ensure that we do not have a regression in any part of the ERP. The more development you add, the longer and more difficult it will be to test all of your processes: this will therefore lower the quality of your deployments and repetitions of bugs in the chain: which will necessarily have a cost but also psychological in trust of the tool and your team. For my part, I know that this part is often the least urgent in a process, however if this is done from the start of your GoLive and in continuity, you will gain enormously, therefore automating your tests as much as possible to allow time your team to manage more strategic cases (training, designs) that a machine will not be able to automate. This is the motto of the PowerAutomate tool of the PowerPlatform : “Take Care of what’s important. Automate the rest” Before going into the details of each testing feature that you can use with Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, it is important to clarify a few things, such as : You CAN’T test everything… well automatically in fact. As you will see in this article, testing some SSRS Reports, layouts, interfaces or other tools will be very complicated to achieve, and a machine is not a human… So keep in mind that all these features will help you to automate as much as possible long tests process, but you will need to do something… Like of course analyzing Plan test reports, see errors log, correct them, tests manual process : but at the end, maybe you will gain 90% of your testing time ! So clearly I invite you to use all the elements that I will present to you. I will not go very deeper in each parts, because it will be too long ! So of course, you can go directly in each Microsoft documentations to go further in details. But keep in mind, that all documentations are presented separately and it seemed important to me to report everything to you in a single document. Data integration testing Do not use RSAT (as you will see after) for integration tests, instead rely on the data management framework (also known as DIXF). The Data task automation framework enables you to configure and automate the testing of your data integration scenarios. Now, we can go ! So, in Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations, you have 3 parts of testing.

Because unit tests are generally testing a method or function, they should always be data agnostic and dependent only on the input data that is provided as part of the test. ATL framework – Microsoft has an ATL framework that is an abstraction on the SysTest framework and makes functional test writing much more simple and reliable. This framework should be used for writing component tests or simple integration tests. RSAT – The RSAT is used for integration tests and business cycle tests. The business cycle tests, also called the regression validation tests, are dependent on existing data. However, these tests can become data agnostic if you consider additional factors. Where unit tests and component tests are low level and can fully be data agnostic (not dependent on existing dataset), the business cycle or regression validation tests are dependent on some existing data. This data includes setup, configuration settings (parameters), and master data (customer, vendors, items, etc.), but never transaction data. Make sure that during the test, if any of these are being changed, that they are reverted back as part of the final test. Select master data based on certain criteria instead of selecting a particular record. For example, if you want to select an item based on its dimension values and stock availability, filter the product list with those values, select the first item, and copy the number to be used for future tests. If it’s a simple master data line such as customer, vendor, or item, it can be created as part of the automation and used in future tests through chaining. Enter the unique identifiers, such as invoice numbers, through the number sequence or by using Microsoft Excel functions such as =TEXT(NOW(),“yyyymmddhhmm”). This function will provide a unique number every minute, which allows you to track when the action happened. This can be used for variables such as product receipt numbers and vendor invoice numbers. These tests continue to work on the same database again and again, without requiring any restoration. Always set the Edit mode of the environment to Read or Edit as the first test case because the default option is Auto. The Auto options always uses the previous setting and can cause unreliable tests. You can change it in the TEST account that will be used in RSAT (User Option) Only validate after you filter on a particular transaction instead of generic validation. For example, for the number of records, filter for the transaction number or the transaction date so that the validation excludes all other transactions. If you are checking a customer balance or budget check, save the value first and then add your transaction value to validate the expected result instead of validating a fixed expected value. ![rsat-data-agnostic-testing-01.png](./Automate your tests for Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations — PowerAzure365_files/rsat-data-agnostic-testing-01.png) ","date":"January 1, 2021","objectID":"/2021-01-01-automate-your-tests-for-dynamics-365-finance/:1:0","tags":["Dynamics 365 Finance","Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management","Dynamics 365 Commerce","AUTOMATED TEST"],"title":"AUTOMATE YOUR TESTS FOR DYNAMICS 365 FINANCE AND OPERATIONS","uri":"/2021-01-01-automate-your-tests-for-dynamics-365-finance/"},{"categories":null,"content":"1/ LCS \u003c=\u003e BPM \u003c=\u003e AzureDevOps (via Task Recorder) You aren’t required to use the Business process modeler (BPM) tool in LCS. However, BPM is the recommended tool if you want to enable the management and distribution of test libraries across projects and tenants. These capabilities are especially useful for Microsoft partners and independent software vendors (ISVs). BPM enables the distribution of test libraries as part of LCS solutions. If you are not using BPM, you can manually create test cases in Azure DevOps and attach developer recording files to your Azure DevOps test cases. You can create developer recording files directly from the Task recorder pane. On my side, I will show you how to create BPM in LCS before going to record all my process with the Task Recorders. So, go to your LCS project first. I will assume also that you have already connect LCS and Azure DevOps together. You can after go to the Business Process Modeler part. ![Screenshot 2020-04-20_21-19-53-857.png](./Automate your tests for Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations — PowerAzure365_files/Screenshot+2020-04-20_21-19-53-857.png) As you will notice here, you have your own BPM and also some done by Microsoft. Of course, in your own company/customer, it’s somehow complicated to have a standard \u0026 global but it will be helpful to check the Microsoft BPM to see how it works. ![Screenshot 2020-04-20_21-21-34-605.png](./Automate your tests for Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations — PowerAzure365_files/Screenshot+2020-04-20_21-21-34-605.png) On my side I will create a complete new one to handle testing purpose. “Normally” before a GoLive it’s a task very highly recommended to do with your Key Users, Project Manager and Functional Consultant. ![Screenshot 2020-04-20_21-25-13-784.png](./Automate your tests for Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations — PowerAzure365_files/Screenshot+2020-04-20_21-25-13-784.png) So as you can see, I’ve created a very basic one, just for an example. My process is only to model my customer creation process. After you can add other child flows, dependent processes etc… Also in BPM, you can have a VISIO model of Flow charts, of all your process in the ERP, has defined in LCS. It can be also a good way to add requirements in AzureDevOps before jumping to do customization. Clearly it’s high level definition, but useful also to not forget some specific process, as well as doing some tutorials practices based on that : as you will see also in Task Recorder, you can do your training documentation with screenshots. That’s why if you do it at the very beginning stage of your implementation, all these process conception will help you not just for testing purpose after or before GoLive !! If you want to learn more, you’ll to go there in the Microsoft documentation below : Learn more on BPM in LCS Now that I’ve done my BPM in LCS, i will need to go to FinOps instance to record all my process flow. Quick tips : Download the Extension to have the featue for Google Chrome to take screenshots (good way for training documentation) : https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/d365-for-finance-and-oper/inifapcodikhojbnbafaalgbgkfmnlob/related?hl=en-GB Go like in an UAT instance, where you have some DEMO data in it or maybe already a copy of your production/live database. Of course, the mandatory data is to have all your reference and master data in it in order to have a whole complete process. (like for my customer flow : Customer Group, Tax Group etc…) When you are in FinOps, go to the top right ! ![Screenshot 2020-04-20_21-43-54-968.png](./Automate your tests for Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations — PowerAzure365_files/Screenshot+2020-04-20_21-43-54-968.png) Click on “Create recording” Give it a name and description if you want. (good if you have multiple different type of flows to create a customer) - activate take screenshots option if you also intend to generate documentation, in addition to being able to recover the trace file for automated tests. ![Scr","date":"January 1, 2021","objectID":"/2021-01-01-automate-your-tests-for-dynamics-365-finance/:2:0","tags":["Dynamics 365 Finance","Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management","Dynamics 365 Commerce","AUTOMATED TEST"],"title":"AUTOMATE YOUR TESTS FOR DYNAMICS 365 FINANCE AND OPERATIONS","uri":"/2021-01-01-automate-your-tests-for-dynamics-365-finance/"},{"categories":null,"content":"2/ RSAT - Regression Suite Automation Tool Overview The Regression suite automation tool (RSAT) significantly reduces the time and cost of user acceptance testing (UAT). UAT is typically required before you take a Microsoft application update, or before you apply custom code and configurations to your production environment. RSAT lets functional power users record business tasks by using Task recorder and then convert the recordings into a suite of automated tests, without having to write source code. For more information about Task recorder, see Task recorder resources. RSAT is fully integrated with Microsoft Azure DevOps for test execution, reporting, and investigation. Test parameters are decoupled from test steps and stored in Microsoft Excel files. RSAT usage is described here in this schema : ![end-to-end.png](./Automate your tests for Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations — PowerAzure365_files/end-to-end.png) First, you will need to install it :) Windows 10 and needed also Excel app. Download RSAT But before going to RSAT directly, go back to your Azure DevOps, you will need a Personal Access Token. ![Sans titre.png](./Automate your tests for Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations — PowerAzure365_files/Sans+titre.png) ![Screenshot 2020-04-20_23-51-45-050.png](./Automate your tests for Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations — PowerAzure365_files/Screenshot+2020-04-20_23-51-45-050.png) Create a new one for RSAT, and make him as expiration date in 1 year, to be safe :) After you need to configure it, to link of course on which environment you need to do your automate testing and. also the Azure DevOps project in which you have setup all test cases. ![RSAT-1.png](./Automate your tests for Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations — PowerAzure365_files/RSAT-1.png) Change your Azure DevOps URL, put your Personal Access Token generated before, you will now use your Project and the Test Plan created in Azure DevOps before. ![RSAT-2.png](./Automate your tests for Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations — PowerAzure365_files/RSAT-2.png) After it’s a little more complicated. Put your hostname, the URL of your FinOps instance without HTTPS. For the SOAP Hostname, it’s the same but with aossoap between the firstpart of your hostname and .sandbox part. Like me below : ![RSAT-3.png](./Automate your tests for Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations — PowerAzure365_files/RSAT-3.png) Put your admin user name email address. The account that will launch every test in your instance. And the company name / legal entity. Keep in mind that we can change on every test the legal entity in a parameter file. For the Thumbprint, it’s a certificate to generate on your computer. Click on new. Copy the number. You will need a technical guy to put it in the environment where you plan to execute the TEST. In the wif.config located in K:\\AosService\\WebRoot -\u003e Don’t forget to apply on each AOS Server ! \u003cauthority name=\"CN=127.0.0.1\"\u003e \u003ckeys\u003e \u003cadd thumbprint=\"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\" /\u003e \u003c/keys\u003e \u003cvalidIssuers\u003e \u003cadd name=\"CN=127.0.0.1\" /\u003e \u003c/validIssuers\u003e \u003c/authority\u003e Save a Working Directory folder and also Default Browser to Google Chrome.

Test isolation Test module creation to manage test code and FormAdaptors. Import Task Recorder recordings into Visual Studio to generate test code. Overview of the ATL framework Integrate a Test module with a build machine. Clearly this part is mostly for developers, but I think it’s useful also for project manager or functional consultant to know which unit test in the code can be done, despite the RSAT tool that we see before. In fact, all task recorders can be a good start to include it in the Development machine to generate simple test case, but I will show also other Framework that developers can use to be more confident before pushing a new development in a TEST environment… So, first best practice, before going to start writing tests, you will need a new model for that ! To achieve that, go to your Visual Studio and create a new one like me : ![Screenshot 2020-04-20_22-43-39-536.png](./Automate your tests for Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations — PowerAzure365_files/Screenshot+2020-04-20_22-43-39-536.png) Important after, select your reference package.

You can now built custom test unit code with SysTestFramework; On my side, I will use the Task Recorder Add-in in VS, but of course, you can built your own one without addin.

Select of course your new model for testing purpose. ![Screenshot 2020-04-20_23-01-07-796.png](./Automate your tests for Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations — PowerAzure365_files/Screenshot+2020-04-20_23-01-07-796.png) You will have a new generate class, like me Change just the top of the class, like adding a SysTestCategory, it will be helpful by doing some filters in the BUILD pipeline of Azure DevOps.

Usually, frameworks are shipped with a set of predefined functions and classes.

Platform platform, on the other hand, provides both the hardware and the software tools needed to run an application – be it a standalone program or one which has been built on top of a framework. Mostly, it comes in the flavor of Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), meaning that the code-base of the platform software itself is not distributed or licensed.

Let go through three examples in the next articles in the series (from the simplest to a more complicated) so we will see the logic behind this process. As easy as it sounds, in this example, we will create a new Vendor Account from Microsoft Forms with only a small number of fields being populate. Note To help simplify the example, the number of fields is minimised. In other words, we will import just enough fields so the new Vendor Account is valid.

The question does not change the usability of the returned response’s value. It can still be mapped to VendAccount not matter what the question is. Note 1-2 The second question is being set in form of a Choice question. The given choices should match with available Vendor Group values found on your D365FO client. If this question is a Text one, chance is that its response might not match with any available Vendor Group values, thus, will return an error during Flow runtime.

This restriction helps guarantee that every method in the chain contributes to the result. In the current implementation of this restriction, the call to next must be in the first-level statements in the method body.” So as described in the article, the Chain Of Command in Dynamics 365 finance and operations is used to add the logic before or after a method of a class is invoked and the original method will always be executed due to the compulsory of the next statement. When doing some implementations, we found out that there is a tricky way to completely ignore the execution of the original method of the class that is extended. Please see below for more details: For example, I created a project and add a new runnable class named Alex: class Alex { public static void main(Args _args) { throw error (\"Hello World\"); } } When this class runs, a Hello World info message will be displayed in the FinOps UI. Then I used chain of command to create Alex_Extension class that extends this class and “override” the main method of the Alex’s class by putting the next call into another method and never call it like this: [ExtensionOf(classStr(Alex))] final class Alex_Extension { public static void main(Args _args) { //Implement something here info (\"Ok\"); void ignore() { next main(_args); } } } When I run the AlexExtension, the original main method of the Alex class will be ignored and only the additional block of code that I wrote in the AlexExtension class will be executed, so only the OK info will appear. Now we will try with a sample scenario from D365 Finance and Operation. In General Ledger Module, we have General journals form When you click the button for Journal Print, the menu item will be triggered and point to the controller name: LedgerJournalController with LedgerJournalController class and the report will be generated. I will use COC to “override” the main method of LedgerJournalController class by applying the method above: [ExtensionOf(classStr(LedgerJournalController))] final class Alex_LedgerJournalController_Extension { public static void main(Args _args) { info(\"ok\"); void ignore_first() { next main(_args); } } } Using this I will ignore the the main method of LedgerJournalController class and instead of generate the report, the result will be only the OK info line in the extension class: This is a little bit tricky because we still call next in our extension class as per the requirement of COC, but as we never call the method that “wrap” the next call so it will not be executed. You can try this to simply ignore or rewrite a method of a class in FinOps. Thank you for reading.

Exception type There are many several types of exception and the type differs depending on what caused the error. Much of exception types are determined by the kernel and are not normally thrown by application code. All exception types, however, can be caught, and it is the developers’ responsibility to decide which exceptions need to be handled. The exception type is identified using the system-based enumeration called an exception. Because it is a system Enum, it cannot be modified, so users cannot add new exception types.

Key commands The Try command signifies the start of a block of code that you want to control with the X++ exception handling system. Any exceptions that are thrown in that block of code can be caught and handled accordingly. The block of code inside the Try statement must be contained between brackets ( { } ). Catch statements come after the block of code and define what code is executed when each exception is thrown. You do not have to define a catch statement for every possible exception; however, each try statement must have at least one catch statement. A Retry command tells the system to go back to the Try statement and attempt to execute the code again. Any data that was loaded before the Try command will remain as it was, but any data retrieved or modified after the Try statement will be refreshed. When a deadlock exception is thrown, all locks on tables that this process holds are released, which may allow the other process or processes that are also deadlocked to continue. By calling a retry, the process can attempt to update the record again and may now be able to complete. It is a best practice that a retry uses a counter so that the number of retries can be controlled, and a user does not become stuck in a loop. The final keyword is now available to follow the try and catch keywords. The semantics are identical to the semantics in C#. The statements provided in the final clause is executed irrespective of whether the try block threw any exceptions.

Optimistic Concurrency Exceptions The optimistic concurrency check (OCC) is a performance enhancing function within Microsoft Dynamics 365 For Operation. It presumes that any record retrieved from the database is not updated until it is proven to be updated by the database. This means that fewer locks must be placed on records in the database. This allows for faster access for other users. This also means that one user can update a record after another user has retrieved it from the database. This can cause data inconsistency. If the second user then also tries to update the record, an UpdateConflict exception is thrown. The system does this by comparing the recVersion field on the record buffer at runtime and the actual record in the database. The recVersion field value is changed every time that an update is successfully made to a record. There are two main table update exceptions, UpdateConflict and DeadLock. An update conﬂict occurs due to the optimistic concurrency failing, whereas a deadlock is the classic database scenario where both transactions have each locked a table that the other needs. Update conﬂicts are normally handled within the insert, delete, and update methods of a table. The BOM table is a good example of this. You may also hard to find many examples where this has been used. We use this pattern only if we deem it to be required. The code within the table’s update method also updates other records, so it has been written to handle update conﬂicts. The following code is an example of how to handle the UpdateConflict exception that might be thrown. public void update() { #OCCRetryCount try { ttsbegin; // code that updates records in other tables super(); // do the update // other code that updates records in other tables ttscommit; } //Deadlock catch (Exception::Deadlock) { retry; } //UpdateConflict catch (Exception::UpdateConflict) { if (appl.ttsLevel() == 0) { if (xSession::currentRetryCount() \u003e= #RetryNum) { throw Exception::UpdateConflictNotRecovered; } else { retry; } } else { throw Exception::UpdateConflict; } } } If a conflict due to OCC occurs, the system throws the UpdateConflict exception and it is caught by the catch statement. The other new element here is ttsLevel. Since transactions can be nested, we do want the exception to falling through to the parent transaction if one exists. If ttsabort is issued (directly or due to a throwing error) at any level, the whole transaction will be rolled back; we can’t roll back just the level where the error is thrown. The code checks the current TTS level. If it is not Zero, in other words, it is still in a TTS transaction, it throws another UpdateConflict exception to the next Catch list of the next outer Try statement in scope. This continues until it is no longer inside a TTS transaction. We must make sure that when the code is retired, all data is refreshed. It is important that we don’t retry indefinitely, as this may cause the client to hang. To control this, we use xSession::currentRetryCount() to get the number of retries and check this against the #RetryNum macro. The macro defines the standard number of retries deemed appropriate by Microsoft, which is five. then the UpdateConflictNotRecovered exception is thrown. This means the whole transaction is aborted and stops retrying.

Desktop Viewer Used to organize and view reports and supporting files. It also stores the report library. Web Viewer Displays Management Reporter reports in a web browser. The Web Viewer does not require an installation of Management Reporter server components. Report schedules A user can schedule a single report or a group of reports to generate regularly. Management Reporter database This SQL database stores the components, known as building blocks, which are used to generate reports. It also stores report definitions and previously generated reports. Application service Controls access to the data provider and provides connectivity to clients. Process service Generates the reports that are created and queued by the Management Reporter client.

I can still use row, column, and tree definitions with multiple reports, and options for the Report definition tabs. Here are some of the functions that are not available in Financial Reporting for Dynamics 365 for Operations: Publishing/distributing reports to SharePoint and/or SharePoint Online locations is not available. Report Viewer/Library has been removed. Import data from an Excel file is not available. XBRL (extensible Business Reporting Language) is no longer available. Comments are not currently available in the web client. Running a consolidation between companies in different instances of AX is not available. The Wizard has been removed. Management Reporter includes direct integration with the Microsoft Dynamics AX general ledger so that there is no need to create a custom connection to the data source. Nevertheless, with custom reporting structures, ledger accounts, and dimensions mapping, creation and the capabilities to publish reports to multiple channels and formats from the desktop, and embedding transactional and analytical reports into a customizable dashboard, Financial Reporting in Dynamics 365 For Operation is all set to simplify the financial reporting process, providing instant insight into your financials.

In this article, I will use a “House (like the houses we live in) “as a real-time example for easy understanding of OOP Concept in C#.

Class Class is a like a Blueprint. Blueprint is outline drawing of our actual plan. For example if we plan to build our new house, the Engineer will explain our new house plan with a blue print as shown in the image below. Once we finalized the plan the engineer will start building the house with same plan. Same like blueprint class is an outline of program. Using the class we can write our own method and declare the variables and using the objects we can access the class Method and Variables. The class will be complete with Variables, Methods and Objects. For more easy understanding of OOP with real world example here I have explained a class with House. We can imagine a House as an example for a Class. In a house, we will have rooms like living room, bedroom, kitchen and items like TV, fridge etc. House owner can access and use all the rooms and rooms' items. Same like this in a Class will have a group of Methods and Variables. Rooms and Rooms’items are example for Methods and Variables. So now, we have a complete house with all rooms and rooms’items. House owner can access and use all the rooms and Rooms' Items. To access and use a Class, methods and variables here we use Objects. Objects are instance of a class. We will see details about objects in the next section. What will happen if there are no rooms and items in a House? It will be empty and no one can use the house until it has all the rooms and Items. See the below image as an example for the empty house. Now this empty house is a Class. So what is the use of a Class without Methods and variable. Now let’s see an example for a Complete House with Rooms and items. So here, we have a complete house. Similarly, the Class will be complete with group of Variables, Methods and Objects. We can see details of all this in next sections of this article. Class and objects are the base concept of OOP – Object Oriented Programming. Class should be started with the Keyword class and next we give the name for our class we can give any meaning full name as Class Name, next we will have the Open and close brackets. using System; public class ClassA { } ","date":"April 11, 2017","objectID":"/2017-04-10-oops_concept/:0:1","tags":["C#","OOP","Object-oriented programming","Class","method"],"title":"Basic C# OOP Concept","uri":"/2017-04-10-oops_concept/"},{"categories":["OOP"],"content":"2. Object As we have already seen that, House Owner will access and use all the Rooms of the House and its Items. Similarly, to access all Class Method and Variable we use Objects. We can create one or many object for a same Class. Example we can say for a house there might be one or many owners. objHouseOwner is the Object for a class which will be used to access all variable and Method of a class. namespace ConsoleApplication1 { class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { Program pro = new Program(); } } } ","date":"April 11, 2017","objectID":"/2017-04-10-oops_concept/:0:2","tags":["C#","OOP","Object-oriented programming","Class","method"],"title":"Basic C# OOP Concept","uri":"/2017-04-10-oops_concept/"},{"categories":["OOP"],"content":"3. Variable Variables are used to store our value. Our value can be numeric or characters for example to store a Phone no we can use int type variable and to store our name we can use string type variable with name for each variable. Variables can be local or Global. For Example, we can say if we buy a new TV , TV Service man will come and setup the TV in our home. He will give his contact number for future contacts. Usually what we do is take a memo paper and write his contact number and keep it in a common place or in a wallet of ours. If we keep the memo in a Common place everyone who is visiting our house can see that contact number. Global or public variables are similar to this. If we declared the variable as Global, All the Methods inside the class can access the variable. If we store the memo Only in our wallet, we can see the contact number. Local or private variables are similar to this. Syntax for variable: Access-Modifiers Data-Type Variable-Name By default the Access-Modifiers are by private, we can also use public to variable. Example of Variable: namespace ConsoleApplication1 { // Example Program class ShanuHouseClass { public int noOfTV = 0; private Boolean doYouHaveTV = true; protected String yourTVName = \"SAMSUNG\"; static void Main(string[] args) { ShanuHouseClass objHouseOwner = new ShanuHouseClass(); Console.WriteLine(\"You Have total \" + objHouseOwner.noOfTV + \" no of TV :\"); Console.WriteLine(\"Your TV Name is :\" + objHouseOwner.yourTVName); Console.ReadLine(); } } } In Above example program I have declared two variables inside a class. In main method I have created object for class. Here we can see using the object we can access the variable of a class and display the output. Main Method is the default Method of C#, where every console and windows application will start the program execution, In the Main Method, we can declare the Object for the class and use the object, and we can access all variables and Methods of a Class. For example, we can say there will be entrance gate for every house. Using the entrance gate we can enter inside our house. Similarly, to run our program there should be some default program execution starting Method. Main method will be useful in this program execution starting point. Whenever we run our C# Console or windows application, first the Main method will be executed .From the main method we can create an object for our other classes and call their Methods.

Method or Functions Method is a group of code statement .Now here we can see the above example program with method. class ShanuHouseClass { public int noOfTV = 2; private Boolean doYouHaveTV = true; protected String yourTVName = \"SAMSUNG\"; public void myFirstMethod() { Console.WriteLine(\"You Have total \" + noOfTV + \"no of TV :\"); Console.WriteLine(\"Your TV Name is :\" + yourTVName); Console.ReadLine(); } } class a { static void Main(string[] args) { ShanuHouseClass a = new ShanuHouseClass(); a.myFirstMethod(); } } Most of developers were wondering about what is the difference between the Method and Function, both Methods and Functions are the same. Here in my article, I will use Method instead of functions. However, there is one difference in Methods and Functions, In OOP Languages like C#, Java etc. We use the term Method while the non-OOP programming like C etc. we use the term Function. What is the use of Methods? Another real-time example let’s take our mobile phone, we can say as we have Mobile phone and store many Songs in it. However, we always like to listen to the selected songs. It will be boring and hard for us to select our favorite song every time and play it. Instead of doing the same work repeatedly, we use the playlist. In playlist, we can add all-favorite songs of ours. Just click on the playlist of our collections and listen to the music. This will make our work easier and we don’t need to do the same thing again and again. Methods are used like a playlist where we can write all our repeated code in one Method and just call the method wherever we needed. In a house, there might be one big room or multiple rooms but each room will have different facilities, similarly in a class we can write one or multiple Methods. In a house, there might be two or three Bedrooms. Here the room name is Bedroom, but each bedroom can be different by size, color etc. This means same Rooms with different type. Similarly, in a class we can create more than one method with the same name but different parameter. In OOP it’s called as Polymorphism we can see details about Polymorphism later on in this article. Syntax for the Functions Access-Modifiers Return-Type Method-Name (Parameter-List) Access-Modifiers: We will see more details about this Topic later on. Return-Type: If our Method returns any value then we use the return Type with any Data Type as String, int etc., if our Method does not return any value then we use the type “Void”. Method-Name: Here we give our Name for every Method, which we create Parameter-List: Parameter-List or Arguments, which we pass to the function. Here is an example of Method: Method with Void Type: Void is a keyword which will not return any data from the Method, for example we can see the below Method with void Type, here in this method we display all our output using the Console.WriteLine and have used the Console.ReadLine()); to get the Input. This Method has all Input and Output Operation but this method don’t return any value. // Function with void and no parameter -- here void means no return type public void veranda() { Console.WriteLine(\"Welcome to Veranda\"); Console.WriteLine(\"How Many Chairs Do you have in your Veranda\"); NoofChair = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine()); Console.WriteLine(\"I have total \" + NoofChair + \" Chairs in my Veranda\"); } Method with Return Type: Method with return type will return some result, which can be used in our program, for example, here we have Method TVNAME with return Type as String. We can say in our home we might have a TV in our LivingROOM and in the parent’s bedroom and also in kids bedroom .We might have different TV brand in each room, suppose if we want to know each room TV Brand Name then we need to enter the same code 3 times. Instead of writing the same code again, we can use a method with Return Type. // Function with Return type as String public string TVNAME() { String YOURTVName; Console.WriteLine(\"Enter Your TV Brand NAME\"); YOURTVName = Co","date":"April 11, 2017","objectID":"/2017-04-10-oops_concept/:0:4","tags":["C#","OOP","Object-oriented programming","Class","method"],"title":"Basic C# OOP Concept","uri":"/2017-04-10-oops_concept/"},{"categories":["OOP"],"content":"5. Access Modifiers Access Modifiers are nothing but the Usage and Limitation of our type like variable, Methods and Class. For Example we can say it as a security limit. This six are the basic Access modifiers which we used in our C# Class/method and in Variables. Private Let’s take our House Example .We will have a Security Guard in House, His duty is till the Entrance of the house. He cannot go inside the house and access all the things. In this case we can create a SecurityGuardClass and declare the variable and method for Security as private . Public House Owners are public to the class where they can access all classes related to the House. They have no restrictions to access their house. Internal Access limit of variable or method is within a project. For example let’s consider in our project we have more than one class and we have declared a variable as internal in one class. Let’s see an example program for internal variable. class Modifiers { public class sampleInternalClass { internal String myInternal = \"Iam Internal Variable\"; } class ShanuHouseClass { int noOfTV = 2; public String yourTVName = \"SAMSUNG\"; public void myFirstMethod() { Console.WriteLine(\"You Have total \" + noOfTV + \"no of TV :\"); Console.WriteLine(\"Your TV Name is :\" + yourTVName); } static void Main(string[] args) { ShanuHouseClass objHouseOwner = new ShanuHouseClass(); objHouseOwner.myFirstMethod(); sampleInternalClass intObj = new sampleInternalClass(); Console.WriteLine(\"Internal Variable Example :\" + intObj.myInternal); Console.ReadLine(); } } } Protected Only the main class and derived class can have access of protected variable or method. For example servants and Guests are example for the Protected. For Example Servants can go to all room and do cleaning and other activates. However, they have limitations of access in the house, as they cannot take rest in a bed of house owner. Protected Internal Protected Internal variable or Method has limitation with in a project of class or Derived class. Here is a sample program for Protect Internal Variable .In this example I have used the Inheritance .we will see in detail about Inheritance more detail in this article. public class sampleProtectedInternalClass { protected internal String myprotectedInternal = \"Iam Protected Internal Variable\"; public void protectedInternalMethod() { Console.WriteLine(\"Protected Internal Variable Example :\" + myprotectedInternal); } } public class derivedClass : sampleProtectedInternalClass { public void derivedprotectedInternal() { Console.WriteLine(\"Derived Protected Internal Variable Example :\" + myprotectedInternal); } } class ShanuHouseClass { int noOfTV = 2; public String yourTVName = \"SAMSUNG\"; public void myFirstMethod() { Console.WriteLine(\"You Have total \" + noOfTV + \"no of TV :\"); Console.WriteLine(\"Your TV Name is :\" + yourTVName); } static void Main(string[] args) { ShanuHouseClass objHouseOwner = new ShanuHouseClass(); objHouseOwner.myFirstMethod(); sampleProtectedInternalClass intObj = new sampleProtectedInternalClass(); intObj.protectedInternalMethod(); derivedClass proIntObj = new derivedClass(); proIntObj.derivedprotectedInternal(); Console.ReadLine(); } } The main and major things we need to know in OOP concept are Encapsulation, Abstraction,Polymorphism and Inheritance. We will discuss them in detail in this article.

Encapsulation Encapsulation is to hide the member or variable to outside class. In our house example, I have already told that House security guard limitation is till the entrance of the house. The security guard doesn’t need to know about what is happening inside the house. Therefore, the House Owner will hide all the happenings to Security guard for more safety. The hiding and limitation are called as Encapsulation. For example, we have two Classes the first one is Houseclass and the other class as houseSecurityClass. Here we can see all the variables are wrap into a class where houseSecurityClass is set as public, so the Houseclass can access that, but houseClass has both Public and private variable where the private variable of a class cannot be accessed outside of the class. //Encapsulation in OOP public class houseSecurityClass { public int noofSecurity; public String SecurityName = String.Empty; } public class Houseclass { private int noofLockerinHosue = 2; public string OwnerName = String.Empty; } ","date":"April 11, 2017","objectID":"/2017-04-10-oops_concept/:0:6","tags":["C#","OOP","Object-oriented programming","Class","method"],"title":"Basic C# OOP Concept","uri":"/2017-04-10-oops_concept/"},{"categories":["OOP"],"content":"7. Abstraction Abstraction is to show and share some common information to the user. Let’s take our House example, in our house we will have servant, servants can go to all rooms and do cleaning and other works. The house owner can give full rights or some partial rights to the servant for accessing his house. Here we can see an example program as private declared variables and Methods are not shared with servant but the public variable and Methods are shared with servant. public class HouseServerntClass { private int SaftyLoackerKeyNo = 10001; public String roomCleanInstructions = \"Clean All rooms\"; private void saftyNos() { Console.WriteLine(\"My SaftyLoackerKeyNo is\" + SaftyLoackerKeyNo); } public void roomCleanInstruction() { Console.WriteLine(roomCleanInstructions); } static void Main(string[] agrs) { HouseServerntClass a = new HouseServerntClass(); a.saftyNos(); a.roomCleanInstruction(); Console.ReadLine(); } } ","date":"April 11, 2017","objectID":"/2017-04-10-oops_concept/:0:7","tags":["C#","OOP","Object-oriented programming","Class","method"],"title":"Basic C# OOP Concept","uri":"/2017-04-10-oops_concept/"},{"categories":["OOP"],"content":"8. Inheritance Inheritance is used to reuse the code. In Protected Internal Access modifier section we have already seen an example program for Inheritance. Inheritance is nothing but accessing and using all base class variable and methods in the Derived Class. Inheritance can be Single level Inheritance With one Base class and one derived Class for example. public class baseClass { private void privateMethod() { Console.WriteLine(\"private Method\"); } public void publicMethod() { Console.WriteLine(\"This Method Shared\"); } } public class DerivedClass : baseClass { static void Main(string[] args) { DerivedClass obj = new DerivedClass(); obj.publicMethod(); //This will be error as private method can not be accessed in Derived Class  obj.privateMethod(); } } The Error is: Some time users might be not clear of what Base class is and what Derived class is. Base class is the super class and derived class is the classes which inherit the base class. Here we can see a simple Inheritance where the base class is the GuestVist and derived class is the HouseOwnerClass. Here HouseOwnerClass class inherits the base class of GuestVist Multi level Inheritance With more than one Derived Class for example. Here we can see an example first base class is derived in DerivedClass1 and then the DerivedClass1 is derived in DerivedClass2 .Now from DerivedClass2 we can access both baseClass and DerivedClass1 variable and methods. public class baseClass { private void privateMethod() { Console.WriteLine(\"private Method\"); } public void publicMethod() { Console.WriteLine(\"This Method Shared\"); } } public class DerivedClass1 : baseClass { public void DerivedClass1() { Console.WriteLine(\"Derived Class 1\"); } } public class DerivedClass2 : DerivedClass1 { static void Main(string[] args) { DerivedClass2 obj = new DerivedClass2(); obj.publicMethod(); obj.DerivedClass1(); //This will be error as private method can not be accessed in Derived Class  //obj.privateMethod(); } } Multiple Inheritance Will the .Net Support Multiple Inheritance? The Answer to this Question is No. In C #, it’s not possible to write a Multiple Inheritance using Class. What is Multiple Inheritance? Multiple Inheritance is nothing but we can have more than one class and we can inherit both Classes in our derived class. What will happen if I write a Multiple Class Inheritance Using C#? Let’s take our example House .Here we have the derived Class as HouseOwnerClass and have Two More classes as GuestVist and FriendsandRelationsClass. Now suppose for our house both Guest and Friend have visited. For this, we write above three classes and inherit the two classes in our derived class. When I write the Multiple Inheritance in C #, it will display the warning message during our code and execute our program. See the below image which shows the Warning error message while I write Multiple Inheritance. * Then how can we use the Multiple Inheritance Interface will be used for Multiple Inheritance.

Polymorphism Ploy means more than one form. In the beginning of the Article at Method Section, we have already seen an example of Polymorphism. Same method name with different parameter is an example for the polymorphism. Method Overloading and Method Overriding will be used in polymorphism. Polymorphism have two types of execution one is Compile Time Polymorphism and the other one is called the Run time Polymorphism. Method Overloading Method overloading are nothing but same Method name will be used for more than one method with different Argument. Here is an example program for the Method Overloading. As we can see here Method name BedRoom has been used for two Method but the parameter for both methods are different. class HouseOwnerClass { //Function with parameter  public void BedRoom(String nameandColor) { Console.WriteLine(nameandColor); } // Same Function Name with Different Paramenter  public void BedRoom(String MemberName, String Color) { Console.WriteLine(MemberName + \" Like \" + Color + \" Color\"); } static void Main(string[] args) { HouseOwnerClass objHouseOwner = new HouseOwnerClass(); objHouseOwner.BedRoom(\"My Name is Shanu I like Lavender color\"); objHouseOwner.BedRoom(\"My Name is Afraz I like Light Blue color\"); objHouseOwner.BedRoom(\"SHANU\", \"Lavender\"); Console.ReadLine(); } } Method Overriding The difference between the Method Overloading and Overriding are.In Method Overloading we will have same method name with different argument. In Method Overriding we will have same Method Name same Argument and same type but method overriding can only be used in the derived class, Method Overriding cannot be done in the same class. We will see how Method Overriding can be used in Abstract Method, Virtual Method and in Sealed Method kindly refer to that section in this article.

Abstract Class/Method Abstract Class: Abstract class will have a keyword abstract. The Abstract class will be as a super class for all our class. Abstract class cannot be accessed by an object, which means we cannot create an object for an abstract class. What will happen when we create an object for an Abstract Class? Here we can see an error warning message as “An instance of an abstract class cannot be created” when I try to create an object for my abstract class. Abstract class can have both Abstract Method and normal Method. In Abstract Class at least one Abstract Method should be declared. In addition, derived class should override the abstract method. To access the abstract method we should use the “override” keyword in our derived class. What will happen if we create an abstract method but which is not override in derived class? Here we can see an abstract class has an abstract method, But the abstract method is not override in the derived class. See the below image for the warning message displaying as class must implement the abstract member. Here we can see an example of Abstract Class and for Abstract Method in detail. In this example, we can see an abstract class, which has normal Method and Abstract Method. Abstract Methods; do not have body part in Abstract Class, which means we can only declare an Abstract Method at Abstract Class, There should be minimum one Abstract Method in an Abstract Class. public abstract class GuestVist { public void Guestwelcomemessage() { Console.WriteLine(\"Welcome to our AbstractHome\"); } public void GuestName() { Console.WriteLine(\"Guest name is: Abstract\"); } public abstract void purposeofVisit(); } // derived class to inherit the abstract class public class A : GuestVist { public override void purposeofVisit() { Console.WriteLine(\"Abstract just came for a Meetup and spend some time \"); } static void Main(string[] args) { A objHouse = new A(); objHouse.purposeofVisit(); objHouse.Guestwelcomemessage(); objHouse.GuestName(); Console.ReadLine(); } } ","date":"April 11, 2017","objectID":"/2017-04-10-oops_concept/:0:10","tags":["C#","OOP","Object-oriented programming","Class","method"],"title":"Basic C# OOP Concept","uri":"/2017-04-10-oops_concept/"},{"categories":["OOP"],"content":"11. Virtual Class/Method Virtual method is very useful in our day-to-day programming. What is virtual Method and what is the use of Virtual Method? Take our House example one guest confirms, as today total five persons will visit your home. For this, we write a function as message display as five Guest visiting our home. Once Guest visits, we see their total 20 persons have visited. In Some cases it might be increase or decrease we will come to know when they reach us. In that case, the guest will be as a Separate Class and House will be as separate class. Without changing the message in Guest class how can we change the data in our Derived class? What is the Difference between Abstract Method and Virtual Method? Both similarities use the override keyword. Abstract Method can only be declared in Abstract Class, which means no body part for abstract method in Abstract class. However, for virtual it can have body part. See the example program below. Here we have both Abstract Method and Virtual Method. In Abstract class, the virtual method says as total five guests but in the derived Class program, the message was override as 20 guests. See the final output in below. Guess what will be displayed for Virtual Method? Will the result be 5 Guests or 20 Guests check for the output below the program. public abstract class GuestVist { public abstract void purposeofVisit(); // Abstract Method  public virtual void NoofGuestwillvisit() // Virtual Method  { Console.WriteLine(\"Total 5 Guest will Visit your Home\"); } } class AbstractHouseClass : GuestVist { public override void purposeofVisit() // Abstract method Override  { Console.WriteLine(\"Abstract just for a Meetup and spend some time \"); } public override void NoofGuestwillvisit() // Virtual method override  { Console.WriteLine(\"Total 20 Guest Visited our Home\"); } static void Main(string[] args) { AbstractHouseClass objHouse = new AbstractHouseClass(); objHouse.purposeofVisit(); objHouse.NoofGuestwillvisit(); Console.ReadLine(); } } ","date":"April 11, 2017","objectID":"/2017-04-10-oops_concept/:0:11","tags":["C#","OOP","Object-oriented programming","Class","method"],"title":"Basic C# OOP Concept","uri":"/2017-04-10-oops_concept/"},{"categories":["OOP"],"content":"12. Sealed Class/Method Sealed Class: As name says this class cannot be inherited by other classes. Take our House Example. In a house, the Houseowner can have a secret room, as might be official or financial rooms. The owner don’t want others to access his official room. The sealed class will be useful in those cases. Sealed class can be declared using the keyword Sealed. If one class is declared as Sealed, it cannot be inherited in other derived classes. What will happen when we inherit sealed class in our derived class? Let’s see an example when I try to inherit my sealed class from my derived class. It shows me the below warning message.

Static Class/Method We have already learned about what is Sealed Class in this Article; now let’s see what are Static Class and Static Method. Both Static and Sealed Class cannot be inherited. What is the Difference between Static Class and Sealed Class? We can create an Object (instance) for the Sealed Class, we can see in my sealed class section I have created a sample Sealed class and in Main Method I have created an object to access the sealed Class. And in a Sealed Class both Static and non-Static methods can be written. But for a Static Class it’s not possible to create an Object. In Static Class only Static members are allowed which means in a static Class it’s not possible to write non-static method. We can say our main method as an example for the Static method. When we create a console application in c# we can see each class will have a default main method. In my article I have explained that when an Console or Windows application start execute first the main method will be executed .There is no need to create an object for the main method since it was been declared as a static method. static void Main(string[] args) Another interesting one in Static class is that memory will be allocated for all static variable and methods during execution but for the non static variable and methods memory will be allocated only when the object for the class are created. Let’s take our same sealed class Example for our static Class and method. What will happen when we inherit Static class in our derived class? Let’s see an example when I try to inherit my static class from my derived class. It shows me the below warning message. What will happen when we declare non-Static method in a Static class? Let’s see an example when I try to create a non-Static method at my Static Class. What will happen when we create an object for the Static class? Let’s see an example when I try to create an object for my Static Class. When we run the program we get the error message as Can not create an instance of a static class How to call the Static Class Method and variable without creating the Object? It’s simple just we can use the ClassName.Variable or Method Name for example OwnerofficialRoom.AllMyPersonalItems(); See the below example with Static class public static class OwnerofficialRoom { public static void AllMyPersonalItems() { Console.WriteLine(\"All Items in this rooms are personal to me no one else can access or inherit me\"); } } class HouseStaticClass { static void Main(string[] args) { OwnerofficialRoom.AllMyPersonalItems(); Console.ReadLine(); } } Is that possible to create a Static Method in non-Static Class? The answer is yes. We can create a Static Method to the non Static class. No need to create an object to access the static method in non-static class. We can directly use the class name to access the Static method. See the below example with Static method in non-static Class. public class OwnerofficialRoom { public static void AllMyPersonalItems() { Console.WriteLine(\"No need to create object for me just use my class name to access me :)\"); } public void non_staticMethod() { Console.WriteLine(\"You need to create an Object to Access Me :(\"); } } class StaticmethodClass { static void Main(string[] args) { // for statci method no need to create object just call directly using the classname.  OwnerofficialRoom.AllMyPersonalItems(); // for non-static method need to create object to access the method.  OwnerofficialRoom obj = new OwnerofficialRoom(); obj.non_staticMethod(); Console.ReadLine(); } } ","date":"April 11, 2017","objectID":"/2017-04-10-oops_concept/:0:13","tags":["C#","OOP","Object-oriented programming","Class","method"],"title":"Basic C# OOP Concept","uri":"/2017-04-10-oops_concept/"},{"categories":["OOP"],"content":"14. Interface Interface is same like abstract class but in Interface we will have only method declaration but in abstract class we can have both method declaration and method definition .Methods of Interface must be implemented in a implementing class. See the below Example program for an Interface. All the methods of Interface have been implemented in the class. As I have already told you that c# don’t support multiple inheritance for using multiple inheritance we can use Interface. This below program is an example for multiple inheritance using Interface. interface GuestInterface { void GuestWelcomeMessage(); void NoofGuestes(); } interface FriendsandRelationsInterface { void friendwelcomemessage(); void FriendName();} class HouseOwnerClass : GuestInterface, FriendsandRelationsInterface { public void GuestWelcomeMessage() { Console.WriteLine(\"All guests are well come to our home\"); } public void NoofGuestes() { Console.WriteLine(\"Total 15 Guestes has visited\"); } public void friendwelcomemessage() { Console.WriteLine(\"Welcome to our Home\"); } public void FriendName() { Console.WriteLine(\"Friend name is: Afraz\"); } static void Main(string[] args) { HouseOwnerClass obj = new HouseOwnerClass(); obj.GuestWelcomeMessage(); obj.NoofGuestes(); obj.friendwelcomemessage(); obj.FriendName(); Console.ReadLine(); } } In some cases we need to have certain methods which will be used in many derived classes. Each derived can implement different functionality for those Methods. In These cases, we can use the Interface. We can say our Guest and house example. For Guest the Welcome Message and No of Guest Function are common, but it will be different for different owners in the same house, Guest might a fathers guest, Mothers Guest, Children’s Guest or Family Guest. Each guest can have different welcome message subject, but the functions are same as Message .let’s consider now Father is a Class, Mother is a class and Children are one Class. Both guestWelcome Message and Noofguest method are same for all. In this case, we can create an Interface and declare both methods in the Interface. All father, mother and Children Classes can inherit the interface and write their own method details. Interface is similar to Abstract class but the major difference between the Abstract Class and the Interface are .In Abstract Class there can be both Abstract Method and Non Abstract methods .But in Interface all methods are abstract by default which means there is no non Abstract type method in the Interface. All the Methods declared in Interface should be override in the derived class. What will happen when non-abstract methods with body part are declared in an Interface? It will display the warning message as unexpected modifier in Access modifier part and Unexpected Method body error warning at message Body. This article repost from here under markdown format.

Using methods from this class allow you to be very precise about what dates you want to use in reports or for filtering your data. Let’s say you have a report that you always want to run to see orders with shipping dates of the next day. It is possible to do so by using one of the methods from the SysQueryRangeUtil. The use of the letter ’t' will work for today’s date, but when you try to add days to it, it doesn’t work in reports. Instead, I will use the currentdate() method and add 1 to it. All methods \u0026 expressions must be surrounded by parentheses as shown below. Filtering the requested ship dates in an AX query for tomorrow (current day() + 1) On any form with a grid, you filter your data by pressing Ctrl+G. If I were to want to see open customer invoices from the last 90 days, I would filter my open customer invoices form and use the method (dayRange(-90,0)). The first number represents how many months backward from this month, and the second represents how many months forward. The same sorts of things can be done for the monthRange(), yearRange(), and dateRange() methods. The best part about this is that you can of course save these filters to create views that you might use on a daily basis. If you are creating your query ranges in code, these methods can also be utilized whenever you are setting them. Definitely be sure to check out the SysQueryRangeUtil class as there are many more methods to use. Here is some methods you can use: {% highlight html %} currentCustomerAccount() currentVendorAccount() currentUserId() currentDate() dateRange() day() dayRange() greaterThanDate() greaterThanUtcDate() greaterThanUtcNow() lessthanDate() lessthanUtcDate() lessthanUtcNow() monthRange() yearRange() \u003e for example: {% highlight html %} (dayRange(-30,0)) – Results in a date range for the last 30 days: \"26-01-2017\"..\"25-02-2017\" (day(-1)) – Results in yesterday's date: 24-02-2017 (day(0)) – Results in today's date: 25-02-2017 (day(1)) – Results in tomorrow's date: 26-02-2017 (greaterThanDate(2)) – Results in every date after today plus 2: \u003e 27-02-2017 (lessThanDate(-1)) – Results in every date of today minus 1: \u003c 24-02-2017 (monthRange(0,2)) – Results in first day till the last day of the month's choosen (0 = current month): \"01-02-2017\"..\"30-04-2017\" (yearRange(-1,-1)) – Results in first day till the last day of the chosen year: \"01-01-2017\"..\"31-12-2017\" Thank you for reading!

The enumeration types are base enumerations and extended data types. The collection types are the built-in array and container types. By default, variables declared as value types are assigned their zero value by the Microsoft Dynamics AX runtime. These variables can’t be set to null.

Reference variables declared as record types reference objects that the Microsoft Dynamics AX runtime instantiates automatically.

A document service is composed of the following components: Document query : This is a query that is created in the Application Object Tree (AOT) and contains all the tables that are related to the business object that you want to expose. Based on this query, the Document Service Generation Wizard can be used to generate the other artifacts that make up the document service. Table AxBC classes : An AxBC class is a wrapper for a table and contains business logic that is needed for Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations. Document class : The purpose of the document class is to contain business logic that is associated with the creation and modification of the business entity itself. For example, the AxdCustomer class could contain logic to handle party information of a customer. Document service class : This is the actual service implementation class and extends the AifDocumentService class. This class implements the service operations that are published through the service contract. When creating document services, developers need to make sure that the business object is mapped correctly to the document query. The document services framework will handle all other things such as the serialization and deserialization of XML, date effectiveness, and so on. Document services can be deployed using the integration ports and all available adapters can be used. Custom services Custom services were already available in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009, but support for Extended Data Types(EDTs) was limited, which resulted in developers having to provide custom serialization and deserialization logic. Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 introduces the concept of attributes. Attributes provide a way to specify metadata about classes and methods. Two of these attributes are used when creating data contracts: the DataContractAttribute and DataMemberAttribute attributes. The ‘DataContractAttribute’ attribute is used to define that a class is a data contract. The’DataMemberAttribute' attribute is added to methods of data contracts that represent data members that have to be exposed. This way of defining data contracts is very similar to other programming languages such as C#. Support for more complex data types such as collections and tables has been added so that these types can be serialized and deserialized without developers having to provide the logic themselves. In a typical custom service you will find the following components: Service contract : A service contract is an X++ class that contains methods with the SysEntryPointAttribute attribute. This identifies methods that will result in a service operation contract when the service is exposed. Data contracts : A data contract is an X++ class that is attributed with the DataContractAttribute attribute. It contains parameter methods that will be attributed as data members for each member variable that needs to be part of the data contract. Custom services can be deployed using the integration ports and any available adapter can be used. System services These services are new since the release of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012. The main difference between these services and the previous two types is that they are not customizable and are not mapped to a query or X++ code. They are not customizable because they are written by Microsoft in managed code. One exception is the user session service, which is written in X++ code but is generally considered as a system service. There are three system services available for use in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012: the query service, the metadata service, and the user session service. Query service The query service provides the means to run queries of the following three types: Static queries defined in the AOT. User-defined queries by using the QueryMetaData class in the service. Dynamic queries that are written in X++ ","date":"November 10, 2016","objectID":"/2016-11-10-types-services-microsoft-dynamics-ax-2012/:0:0","tags":["aif","xpp","aos"],"title":"Types of services in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012","uri":"/2016-11-10-types-services-microsoft-dynamics-ax-2012/"},{"categories":["AX 2012","Data"],"content":"SUMMARY Tool can be used for two different purposes.

The tool minimally changes data during the import process. The only data the tool changes are the entity IDs (IDs related to table, field, etc.) that are stored as data and that could change with each deployment. The tool recognizes the changes and patches the data with the AXIDs of the system that the data is being imported into. The data file format is the standard format produced by SQL Server bcp.

An other example is fetching parameters from parameter tables, eg InventParameters::find(). On a table, you have to fetch it each time you call a method.

The client never accesses the database or metadata directly. AOS sends the application objects and data to the client. The data layer that the client uses is based on data sources that are specified in metadata for forms and queries. In addition, any X++ code that is required to retrieve data can use the built-in language support to query and adjust data. The client uses a report Web Part to interact with the report server. By calling the web services that are exposed by the report server, the report control in the Web Part displays information that is contained in Reporting Services reports. These reports can include either transnational data from the Microsoft Dynamics AX application or OLAP cubes from Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services. Cubes provide business analytic and key performance indicators (KPIs). The client provides workflow forms, alerts, and controls so that users can participate in the business process by using the Workflow system. The Workflow system is a Microsoft Dynamics AX component that enables workflow processes by using Windows Communication Foundation classes. The client provides a Help viewer, which is an application that displays context-sensitive Help topics. The Help topics are retrieved from a Help server that is located on-premises. The client also provides Role Centers, or role-based home pages, for users. Role Centers provide role-specific tasks, activities, alerts, reports, and business intelligence that help users increase their productivity. To interact with the Role Centers that are provided by Enterprise Portal and hosted on Internet Information Services (IIS), the client uses a browser control.

These clients and applications include AX components such as the AX client, Office Add-, and Enterprise Portal. Internet-based external applications and clients access the AX services through Internet Information Services (IIS). IIS routes the incoming requests for AX services to AOS. All services requests, regardless of their origin, are handled by the WCF runtime that is hosted on AOS. The AIF request preprocessor, if it is configured, can intercept the inbound request messages for custom preprocessing, such as message transforms or value substitutions. The AX service invokes the necessary business logic to process the inbound request message. Similarly, the AIF response postprocessor, if it is configured, can intercept the outbound response messages for custom post-processing, such as message transforms or value substitutions.

I mean, programming, and lovin’ it. Even if I’m not so good. helloworldhelloworld \" helloworld I’ve heard a thousand of guys telling stories like: “When I was twelve my parents bought me my first computer and I started learning on my own.” or “I won a programming contest when I was in highschool”. Great. Well done. I’ve never noticed about what coding was until I was eighteen, when I had to decide what to study at the University. Do you want to know what was I thinking about? First option: Computer Science. Second option: Arts (wtf?). Third option: Philosophy (WTF?). I’ve ever liked computers, yes, but I’d never thought I could do that amazing things with them. I also liked maths, puzzles, things that made my brain think hard and get fun at the same time. You know, quizes, enigmas, games… The conclusion was that I wanted to do something creative, where I could put my imagination on, where I could challenge myself in order to create new stuff. My first programming class was awful. I didn’t get nothing, and everyone seemed to be so cool on it, everyone with this big “Hello World” in their screens and a smile in their faces like ‘Yeah dude, I did it.”. I didn’t even know what to write down, or what was the teacher talking about. I was so frustrated, my first exam was… well, I don’t want to talk about my first exam. One day, I don’t know how, something changed. Suddenly, I realized what programming was. I really abstracted my mind, I looked at it from another perspective, and it came with me so clear and so beautiful and I can not explain with words what I felt. Was it easier from then? Not at all. In fact, I left Computer Science after the first year, with almost all the subjects passed, because there was still something that made me think I was not made for it. I was so lost, I didn’t know what to do with my life. I really liked programming, but there were so much thinks that seemed to be so far away from me. And I felt that everyone around me was going good on it, it was so frustrating that I couldn’t stand it anymore. Then, I decided I had to change my situation because there should be something out there waiting for me. I looked for other degrees in a lot of universities. It was. I do really love what I’m studying now, but the truth is that I think I’ve found my way. Actually, I will finish also Computer Science someday, but in a different place. And I’m still getting frustrated, of course, who doesn’t?, but I know I learned to love that frustration. Let me explain myself. Programming is that. Is try it out thousand of times. Is try to find a mistake between a million lines of code, it’s to abstract your mind to find an answer, it’s… beautiful. I know really good programmers that honestly, I think I’ll never reach out, I have not that brilliant brain. But I keep on trying it, I’m not the best, I just love what I do. Maybe this post is not just about programming, maybe is more about to find out what do you really love. Even if sometimes you hate it, or it makes you cry, or it makes you feel so stupid because you are not able to understand it, or if it makes you think there is a lot of people smarter than you doing the same thing better. Just… enjoy your time, fight for what you want, challenge yourself to go to the next step.
