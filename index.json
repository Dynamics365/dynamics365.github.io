The following is a comparison of two search engines: lunr: simple, no need to synchronize index.json, no limit for contentLength, but high bandwidth and low performance (Especially for Chinese which needs a large segmentit library) algolia: high performance and low bandwidth, but need to synchronize index.json and limit for contentLength The content of the post is separated by h2 and h3 HTML tag to improve query performance and basically implement full-text search. contentLength is used to limit the max index length of the part starting with h2 and h3 HTML tag. Tips about algolia You need to upload index.json files to algolia to activate searching. You could upload the index.json files by browsers but a CLI tool may be better. The official Algolia CLI is a good choice.

To avoid this limitations, Hugo created shortcodes. A shortcode is a simple snippet that can generate reasonable HTML code and conforms to Markdown’s design philosophy.

You can reference page resources by the value for Resources.GetMatch or the filepath of the resource relative to the page directory directly. Store resources in the assets directory, which is /assets by default. The filepath of the resource to reference in the post is relative to the assets directory. Store resources in the static directory, which is /static by default. The filepath of the resource to reference in the post is relative to the static directory. The priority of references is also in the above order. There are many places in the theme where the above local resource references can be used, such as links, images, image shortcode, music shortcode and some params in the front matter. Images in page resources or assets directory processing will be supported in the future. It’s really cool!

Tip Here is a list of $\\TeX$ functions supported by $\\KaTeX$. Note Since Hugo generates HTML documents according to the syntax such as _/*/\u003e\u003e when rendering Markdown documents, and some text content in the form of escape characters (such as \\(/\\)/\\[/\\]/\\\\) escape processing will be performed automatically, therefore, additional escape character expressions are required for these places to achieve automatic rendering: _ -\u003e \\_ * -\u003e \\* \u003e\u003e -\u003e \\\u003e\u003e \\( -\u003e \\\\( \\) -\u003e \\\\) \\[ -\u003e \\\\[ \\] -\u003e \\\\] \\\\ -\u003e \\\\\\\\ LoveIt theme supports raw shortcode to avoid these escape characters, which helps you write raw mathematical formula content. Example raw input: Inline Formula: Block Formula: The rendered output looks like this: Inline Formula: Block Formula: Inline Formula The default inline delimiters are: $ ... $ \\( ... \\) (escaped: \\\\( ... \\\\)) For example: $c = \\pm\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$ and \\\\(f(x)=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\hat{f}(\\xi) e^{2 \\pi i \\xi x} d \\xi\\\\) The rendered output looks like this: $c = \\pm\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$ and \\(f(x)=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\hat{f}(\\xi) e^{2 \\pi i \\xi x} d \\xi\\) Block Formula The default block delimiters are: $$ ... $$ \\[ ... \\] (escaped: \\\\[ ... \\\\]) \\begin{equation} ... \\end{equation} (unnumbered: \\begin{equation*} ... \\end{equation*}) \\begin{align} ... \\end{align} (unnumbered: \\begin{align*} ... \\end{align*}) \\begin{alignat} ... \\end{alignat} (unnumbered: \\begin{alignat*} ... \\end{alignat*}) \\begin{gather} ... \\end{gather} (unnumbered: \\begin{gather*} ... \\end{gather*}) \\begin{CD} ... \\end{CD} For example: $$ c = \\pm\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} $$ \\\\[ f(x)=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\hat{f}(\\xi) e^{2 \\pi i \\xi x} d \\xi \\\\] \\begin{equation*} \\rho \\frac{\\mathrm{D} \\mathbf{v}}{\\mathrm{D} t}=\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbb{P}+\\rho \\mathbf{f} \\end{equation*} \\begin{equation} \\mathbf{E}=\\sum_{i} \\mathbf{E}\\_{i}=\\mathbf{E}\\_{1}+\\mathbf{E}\\_{2}+\\mathbf{E}_{3}+\\cdots \\end{equation} \\begin{align} a\u0026=b+c \\\\\\\\ d+e\u0026=f \\end{align} \\begin{alignat}{2} 10\u0026x+\u00263\u0026y = 2 \\\\\\\\ 3\u0026x+\u002613\u0026y = 4 \\end{alignat} \\begin{gather} a=b \\\\\\\\ e=b+c \\end{gather} \\begin{CD} A @\u003ea\\\u003e\u003e B \\\\\\\\ @VbVV @AAcA \\\\\\\\ C @= D \\end{CD} The rendered output looks like this: $$ c = \\pm\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} $$ \\[ f(x)=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\hat{f}(\\xi) e^{2 \\pi i \\xi x} d \\xi \\] \\begin{equation*} \\rho \\frac{\\mathrm{D} \\mathbf{v}}{\\mathrm{D} t}=\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbb{P}+\\rho \\mathbf{f} \\end{equation*} \\begin{equation} \\mathbf{E}=\\sum_{i} \\mathbf{E}_{i}=\\mathbf{E}_{1}+\\mathbf{E}_{2}+\\mathbf{E}_{3}+\\cdots \\end{equation} \\begin{align} a\u0026=b+c \\\\ d+e\u0026=f \\end{align} \\begin{alignat}{2} 10\u0026x+\u00263\u0026y = 2 \\\\ 3\u0026x+\u002613\u0026y = 4 \\end{alignat} \\begin{gather} a=b \\\\ e=b+c \\end{gather} \\begin{CD} A @\u003ea\u003e\u003e B \\\\ @VbVV @AAcA \\\\ C @= D \\end{CD} Tip You can add more inline and block delimiters in your site configuration.

Let’s face it: Writing content for the Web is tiresome. WYSIWYG editors help alleviate this task, but they generally result in horrible code, or worse yet, ugly web pages. Markdown is a better way to write HTML, without all the complexities and ugliness that usually accompanies it. Some of the key benefits are: Markdown is simple to learn, with minimal extra characters, so it’s also quicker to write content. Less chance of errors when writing in Markdown. Produces valid XHTML output. Keeps the content and the visual display separate, so you cannot mess up the look of your site. Write in any text editor or Markdown application you like. Markdown is a joy to use! John Gruber, the author of Markdown, puts it like this: The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters, the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email. – John Gruber Without further delay, let us go over the main elements of Markdown and what the resulting HTML looks like!

Requirement sets can be specific to Office hosts, such as an ExcelApi 1.7 set, or common to multiple hosts, such as the Dialog API. Requirement set support varies by Office host and host version.

You put your add-in code in this method, and it gets called once the Office.js library has initialized. Inside the onReady() method, you can determine which host your add-in is running in by checking the Office.HostType enum value (for example, Excel or Word). You can check which platform your add-in is running on with an Office.PlatformType enum value (for example, PC or Mac). If you’re using additional JavaScript frameworks that include their own initialization handler or tests, they should be placed within the response to Office.onReady(). For example, you would reference JQuery’s $(document).ready() function as shown in the following code example. Office.onReady(function() { // Office is ready. $(document).ready(function () { // The document is ready. }); }); ","date":"October 8, 2021","objectID":"/2021-10-07-extend-microsoft-365/:6:2","tags":["Microsoft 365"],"title":"Extend Microsoft 365 with office add-ins","uri":"/2021-10-07-extend-microsoft-365/"},{"categories":["Microsoft 365"],"content":"2.1.3. Making asynchronous calls using proxy objects When you work with a document, requested read or write actions are batched up using a proxy object. Your API calls don’t actually read or update the underlying document until you call the sync() method. For better security, your add-in runs in a sandboxed JavaScript environment that can’t directly access the document, or other add-ins. The Office add-ins platform provides a RequestContext object that in turn provides proxy objects to represent the document (such as worksheets, ranges, and tables). The RequestContext is typically passed to your code as a parameter named context. You can use the context object to get any proxy objects you need to work with the document. Before you can read the properties of a proxy object, you must load the properties to populate the proxy object with data from the Office document. You do this by calling the load() method on the proxy object for any properties you need. Then call the context.sync() method, which will load all of the requested properties. For example, if you create a proxy range object to work with a user-selected range in an Excel worksheet, and then want to read the selected range’s address property, you need to load the address property before you can read it. To request properties of a proxy object to be loaded, call the load() method on the object and specify the properties to load. The following example shows a function that defines a local proxy object (selectedRange), loads the address property of that object, then calls context.sync(). When the promise from context.sync() is resolved, the code can then read the address property. Excel.run is required for this specific host, to load properties that affect platform behavior when the function runs. Not all hosts contain a run call. Excel.run(function (context) { var selectedRange = context.workbook.getSelectedRange(); selectedRange.load('address'); return context.sync() .then(function () { console.log('The selected range is: ' + selectedRange.address); }); }).catch(function (error) { console.log('error: ' + error); if (error instanceof OfficeExtension.Error) { console.log('Debug info: ' + JSON.stringify(error.debugInfo)); } }); ","date":"October 8, 2021","objectID":"/2021-10-07-extend-microsoft-365/:6:3","tags":["Microsoft 365"],"title":"Extend Microsoft 365 with office add-ins","uri":"/2021-10-07-extend-microsoft-365/"},{"categories":["Microsoft 365"],"content":"2.2.

Key features 2.4.2.1. Authentication Your Outlook add-in can access information from anywhere on the Internet. A few examples include the server that hosts the add-in, your internal network, or elsewhere in the cloud. If that information is protected, your add-in needs a way to authenticate your user. Outlook add-ins provide a number of different methods to authenticate, depending on your specific scenario. Access token Use if your add-in… Exchange user identity tokens Is used primarily by Exchange on-premises users. Needs access to a non-Microsoft service that you control. OAuth2 access tokens Needs access to a third-party service outside of your control. Callback tokens Needs access to the user’s mailbox from your server. 2.4.2.2. Contextual add-ins Contextual add-ins are Outlook add-ins that activate based on text in a message or appointment. You may have seen the default contextual add-ins in Outlook, such as Bing Maps or Suggested Meetings. Using contextual add-ins, a user can initiate tasks related to a message without leaving the message itself, which results in an easier and richer user experience. User chooses… Contextual add-in action Address Open a map of the location. String Open a meeting suggestion add-in. Phone number Add number to your contacts. Contextual add-ins are not currently available in Outlook on Android and iOS at this time. The following image shows a contextual add-in displayed in Outlook. A contextual add-in’s manifest must include an ExtensionPoint element with an xsi:type attribute set to DetectedEntity. Within the ExtensionPoint element, the add-in specifies the entities or regular expression that can activate it. If an entity is specified, the entity can be any of the properties in the Entities object. As such, the add-in manifest must contain a rule of type ItemHasKnownEntity or ItemHasRegularExpressionMatch. The following example shows how to specify that an add-in should activate on messages when it detects a phone number. \u003cExtensionPoint xsi:type=\"DetectedEntity\"\u003e \u003cLabel resid=\"contextLabel\" /\u003e \u003cSourceLocation resid=\"detectedEntityURL\" /\u003e \u003cRule xsi:type=\"RuleCollection\" Mode=\"And\"\u003e \u003cRule xsi:type=\"ItemIs\" ItemType=\"Message\" /\u003e \u003cRule xsi:type=\"ItemHasKnownEntity\" EntityType=\"PhoneNumber\" Highlight=\"all\" /\u003e \u003c/Rule\u003e \u003c/ExtensionPoint\u003e After a contextual add-in is associated with an account, it will automatically start when the user clicks a highlighted entity or regular expression. A user launches a contextual add-in through text, either a known entity or a developer’s regular expression. Typically, a user identifies a contextual add-in because the entity is highlighted. 2.4.2.3. Module add-ins Module add-ins appear in the Outlook navigation bar, right alongside mail, tasks, and calendars. You can use all of the features of the Outlook JavaScript API in your add-in, and create command buttons in the Outlook ribbon so the user can interact with the add-in content. Module add-ins are only supported in Outlook 2016 or later on Windows. The following image shows an example of a module extension add-in. To make a module add-in, include the module extension point in your add-in’s manifest file. The following example shows a snippet of a manifest file adjusted to define a module extension. ... \u003c!-- Add Outlook module extension point. --\u003e \u003cVersionOverrides xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/mailappversionoverrides\" xsi:type=\"VersionOverridesV1_0\"\u003e \u003cVersionOverrides xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/mailappversionoverrides/1.1\" xsi:type=\"VersionOverridesV1_1\"\u003e \u003c!-- Begin override of existing elements. --\u003e \u003cDescription resid=\"residVersionOverrideDesc\" /\u003e \u003cRequirements\u003e \u003cbt:Sets DefaultMinVersion=\"1.3\"\u003e \u003cbt:Set Name=\"Mailbox\" /\u003e \u003c/bt:Sets\u003e \u003c/Requirements\u003e \u003c!-- End override of existing elements. --\u003e \u003cHosts\u003e \u003cHost xsi:type=\"MailHost\"\u003e \u003cDesktopFormFactor\u003e \u003c!-- Set the URL of the file that contains the JavaScript function that controls the extension. --\u003e \u003cFunctionFile resid=\"residFunct","date":"October 8, 2021","objectID":"/2021-10-07-extend-microsoft-365/:9:2","tags":["Microsoft 365"],"title":"Extend Microsoft 365 with office add-ins","uri":"/2021-10-07-extend-microsoft-365/"},{"categories":["Microsoft 365"],"content":"2.5.

Key scenarios You can apply simple formatting to an entire existing document using the Office.js APIs. However, if you wish to apply complex formatting or use rich content objects, you can use Office Open XML (OOXML) to create these effects. Examples of capabilities in OOXML include applying drop shadows to text or pictures, coercing text boxes into shapes, and inserting Excel charts as live charts in Word documents. Because this is a more advanced skill, we will not cover this subject in its entirety but mention it for developers who are familiar with OOXML. 2.5.2.1. Working with document text Word add-ins use the Office.onReady() event handler to start. If the add-in targets Word 2016 or later, it calls the Word.run() method to run Word JavaScript APIs. The add-in must pass a function to Word.run() that expects a context object to be passed as the parameter. The context object allows the add-in to interact with the Word document. You can use the context object to create any needed proxy objects for the Word document and load the proxies with any properties you wish to use. You can also program actions to run using those properties. As always, a context.sync() command then synchronizes the state between the proxy objects and objects in the Word document. The following example shows code that inserts text after the body text of a Word document. For simplicity, this sample omits the Office.onReady() code and focuses on the code within a Word.run() code block. // Run a batch operation against the Word JavaScript API. Word.run(function (context) { // Create a proxy object for the document body. var body = context.document.body; // Queue a command to load the text property of the proxy body object. body.load(\"text\"); // Queue a command to insert text into the end of the Word document body. body.insertText('This is text inserted after loading the body.text property', Word.InsertLocation.end); // Synchronize the document state by executing the queued commands, // and return a promise to indicate task completion. return context.sync().then(function () { console.log(\"Body contents: \" + body.text); }); }) 2.5.2.2. Search You can use the APIs to search the document for text that meets your criteria. You can also scope your search to certain types of content, for example, paragraphs or tables. The following code sample searches for the text “video you” and ignores punctuation. If the text is found, the matches are bolded, highlighted in yellow, and the font color set to purple. // Run a batch operation against the Word object model. Word.run(function (context) { // Queue a command to search the document and ignore punctuation. var searchResults = context.document.body.search('video you', {ignorePunct: true}); // Queue a command to load the search results and get the font property values. context.load(searchResults, 'font'); // Synchronize the document state by executing the queued commands, // and return a promise to indicate task completion. return context.sync().then(function () { console.log('Found count: ' + searchResults.items.length); // Queue a set of commands to change the font for each found item. for (var i = 0; i \u003c searchResults.items.length; i++) { searchResults.items[i].font.color = 'purple'; searchResults.items[i].font.highlightColor = '#FFFF00'; //Yellow searchResults.items[i].font.bold = true; } // Synchronize the document state by executing the queued commands, // and return a promise to indicate task completion. return context.sync(); }); }) .catch(function (error) { console.log('Error: ' + JSON.stringify(error)); if (error instanceof OfficeExtension.Error) { console.log('Debug info: ' + JSON.stringify(error.debugInfo)); } }); ","date":"October 8, 2021","objectID":"/2021-10-07-extend-microsoft-365/:10:2","tags":["Microsoft 365"],"title":"Extend Microsoft 365 with office add-ins","uri":"/2021-10-07-extend-microsoft-365/"},{"categories":["Microsoft 365"],"content":"2.5.3.

Also, you can’t access the Office.js API to interact with the document like you can from a task pane. Instead, the custom functions runtime is optimized for tasks such as performing rapid calculations and generally doesn’t need to use some of the Office.js APIs such as formatting tools in Excel.

Using storage API to communicate with the task pane Custom function code and task pane code (which uses Office.js) can’t call or communicate directly with each other. But you can use a storage API that allows them to share data. A common scenario for using the storage API is when the add-in needs to share a security token for accessing a secure network resource. The user might first call a custom function that requires them to be signed in. After authentication, it receives the security token. Then it shares the security token using the storage API so that later, when the user opens the task pane, the task pane doesn’t need to sign them in again. Alternatively, the user might open the task pane first. In this case, the task pane will sign in the user and share the security token through the storage API. When a custom function is used later, the custom function can get the security token through the storage API. 2.6.3.1.

How to authorize to Microsoft Graph Authentication The add-in can get an access token from Azure Active Directory (AAD) when the user has signed in. AAD doesn’t allow its sign-in page to open in an iframe, and the add-in task pane is an iframe when the add-in is launched in Office on the Web. So, use the Office JavaScript Dialog API to display the AAD login form. If your add-in includes custom functions that need authorization to Microsoft Graph, use the custom functions Dialog API to display the login form. Authorization After the user signs in, your add-in gets an access token to use in subsequent API calls to Microsoft Graph. The access token can never give the add-in more or greater permissions than the user has. Users typically only have permissions to data about themselves, their own files and email, and objects that have been shared with them. If your add-in gets Microsoft Graph data about multiple users, then it can be used successfully only by users with admin-level permissions. Recommended libraries Depending on your development choices, you can use one of the following libraries for authentication and authorization as appropriate. Your server-side is on a .NET-based framework (for example, .NET Core or ASP.NET): use MSAL.NET Your server-side is node.js-based: use Passport Azure AD Your add-in uses Implicit flow: use msal.js 4.

Usually, frameworks are shipped with a set of predefined functions and classes. When using Spring (Java) or Symfony (PHP) for example, programmers do not need to think about things such as persistence, routing and session management too much because the work is done by standardized framework components. Platform platform, on the other hand, provides both the hardware and the software tools needed to run an application – be it a standalone program or one which has been built on top of a framework. Mostly, it comes in the flavor of Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), meaning that the code-base of the platform software itself is not distributed or licensed.

Example two: A new Forms response is submitted then Flow promts for an approval request before a new record is created in Vendors table In the last example, we created a simple Flow to create a new Vendor Account from submitted Forms responses.

To make the process more reliable, we will now add an approval step to the Flow. It means before a new Vendor Account is created, the user will have the right to Approve or Reject the request. 1.1.

Example three: From the created record in Vendors table, add related records in other tables In the last example, we added an Approval step to the Flow which will allow users to give Approve or Reject action toward the request coming from the Form. We can actually utilise the Flow one step further: To create additional records on different tables that might depend on the created record in VendTable. To make it easier to understand, the process is like this: Create a new Vendor Account by using input from the Form. Create a new Bank Account with the Bank Account ID exactly similar to the Vendor Account. Add some contact details to the Vendor Account. Which entities should we target to? They are: For Vendor Bank Account: VendorBankAccounts For Vendor Contact Details: PartyContacts You can play around in Visual Studio to get used to looking for an Entity that might fulfil the requirements of your intergration. Check out the next part of this article to get some quick tips into that. Assuming that we now have a Flow as we configured in the last two examples, we can add some more steps like these underneath. 2.1. Step 1: Add a new step to add a new record to VendorBankAccounts and PartyContacts Given the case that we had a Vendor Account and Bank Account for that Vendor Account, the records would be like this. Relation in SSMS The relation should be: VendTable.AccountNum = VendBankAccount.VendAccount On the client, the information should be illustrated like this. Vendor Bank Account And, when checking the Bank Account details, we would find. Vendor Bank Details Now, to do so, we will add a new step right after the creation of VendTable record. A new step Instance = Environment URL (same as any other steps) Entity name = VendorBankAccounts (check my post about good tips with Visual Studio to know how to find the Data Entity) Supplier account = Supplier account from last step Bank account= Supplier account from last step (Because I would like to have same Vendor Account and Bank Account) When saying “from the last step”, I meant this. Selecting Dynamic Content from former steps In MS FLow, any steps that are already executed will have outputs. We, in this step, are taking the Supplier Account from the last step of creating a new record in VendTable . This dynamic content was generated when the new record is created. Note 3-1 Keep in mind that if the last step is not “Creating a new record”, chance is that you cannot take the output from it because there’s simply none. Click on Show advanced options so we can add more information to the Vendor Bank Account. Select Show advanced options Add more details to the bank account: Name = Bank account name chosen from the Form using Dynamic Content (we don’t want to copy any more values from the VendTable record - we actually will specify a bank account name when composing a response on the Form) Bank account number = Bank account number chosen from the Form using Dynamic Content Add more details to bank account We finished with Vendor Bank Account. We will do just the same with the record in PartyContacts. Party ID = Party ID from VendTable record Contact number/address = Email from the Form (in this case, I would like to add an email address - it is totally up to you to opt to add phone number, Skype, Twitter and some other contact detail that D365FO is supporting) Purpose = I am “hard-coding” this \"Business\" (the supported purpose of Contact can be found on Vendor Card on D356FO client - this purpose should mainly be used when sending emails, i.e. D365FO want to send Purchase Order Confirmation to any email addresses with purpose \"Invoice\") Vendor Contact Details 2.2.

This, however, requires a certain extent of experience working with data integration on D365FO. Given the case that we would like to import data to All Vendors, we will start our search in Workspaces \u003e Data Management \u003e Data Entities.

OData client configuration Download the project here https://github.com/microsoft/Dynamics-AX-Integration Open ServiceSamples solution.

Open ODataClient.tt, in MetadataDocumentUri add “https://.cloudax.dynamics.com/data/$metadata” If you save the ODataClient.tt file, it will generate Odata proxies and classes.

Exception type There are many several types of exception and the type differs depending on what caused the error. Much of exception types are determined by the kernel and are not normally thrown by application code.

The exception type is identified using the system-based enumeration called an exception. Because it is a system Enum, it cannot be modified, so users cannot add new exception types.

Key commands The Try command signifies the start of a block of code that you want to control with the X++ exception handling system. Any exceptions that are thrown in that block of code can be caught and handled accordingly. The block of code inside the Try statement must be contained between brackets ( { } ). Catch statements come after the block of code and define what code is executed when each exception is thrown. You do not have to define a catch statement for every possible exception; however, each try statement must have at least one catch statement. A Retry command tells the system to go back to the Try statement and attempt to execute the code again. Any data that was loaded before the Try command will remain as it was, but any data retrieved or modified after the Try statement will be refreshed. When a deadlock exception is thrown, all locks on tables that this process holds are released, which may allow the other process or processes that are also deadlocked to continue. By calling a retry, the process can attempt to update the record again and may now be able to complete. It is a best practice that a retry uses a counter so that the number of retries can be controlled, and a user does not become stuck in a loop. The final keyword is now available to follow the try and catch keywords. The semantics are identical to the semantics in C#. The statements provided in the final clause is executed irrespective of whether the try block threw any exceptions.

Please try again\"); } } } } This code will try to create a customer after revived inputted value from users, this code also handling errors when user do not input enough information. A Throw statement is used to throw an error that can be caught by a Catch statement.

Optimistic Concurrency Exceptions The optimistic concurrency check (OCC) is a performance enhancing function within Microsoft Dynamics 365 For Operation. It presumes that any record retrieved from the database is not updated until it is proven to be updated by the database. This means that fewer locks must be placed on records in the database. This allows for faster access for other users. This also means that one user can update a record after another user has retrieved it from the database. This can cause data inconsistency. If the second user then also tries to update the record, an UpdateConflict exception is thrown. The system does this by comparing the recVersion field on the record buffer at runtime and the actual record in the database. The recVersion field value is changed every time that an update is successfully made to a record. There are two main table update exceptions, UpdateConflict and DeadLock. An update conﬂict occurs due to the optimistic concurrency failing, whereas a deadlock is the classic database scenario where both transactions have each locked a table that the other needs. Update conﬂicts are normally handled within the insert, delete, and update methods of a table. The BOM table is a good example of this. You may also hard to find many examples where this has been used. We use this pattern only if we deem it to be required. The code within the table’s update method also updates other records, so it has been written to handle update conﬂicts. The following code is an example of how to handle the UpdateConflict exception that might be thrown. public void update() { #OCCRetryCount try { ttsbegin; // code that updates records in other tables super(); // do the update // other code that updates records in other tables ttscommit; } //Deadlock catch (Exception::Deadlock) { retry; } //UpdateConflict catch (Exception::UpdateConflict) { if (appl.ttsLevel() == 0) { if (xSession::currentRetryCount() \u003e= #RetryNum) { throw Exception::UpdateConflictNotRecovered; } else { retry; } } else { throw Exception::UpdateConflict; } } } If a conflict due to OCC occurs, the system throws the UpdateConflict exception and it is caught by the catch statement. The other new element here is ttsLevel. Since transactions can be nested, we do want the exception to falling through to the parent transaction if one exists. If ttsabort is issued (directly or due to a throwing error) at any level, the whole transaction will be rolled back; we can’t roll back just the level where the error is thrown. The code checks the current TTS level. If it is not Zero, in other words, it is still in a TTS transaction, it throws another UpdateConflict exception to the next Catch list of the next outer Try statement in scope. This continues until it is no longer inside a TTS transaction. We must make sure that when the code is retired, all data is refreshed. It is important that we don’t retry indefinitely, as this may cause the client to hang. To control this, we use xSession::currentRetryCount() to get the number of retries and check this against the #RetryNum macro. The macro defines the standard number of retries deemed appropriate by Microsoft, which is five. then the UpdateConflictNotRecovered exception is thrown. This means the whole transaction is aborted and stops retrying.

Desktop Viewer Used to organize and view reports and supporting files. It also stores the report library. Web Viewer Displays Management Reporter reports in a web browser. The Web Viewer does not require an installation of Management Reporter server components. Report schedules A user can schedule a single report or a group of reports to generate regularly. Management Reporter database This SQL database stores the components, known as building blocks, which are used to generate reports. It also stores report definitions and previously generated reports. Application service Controls access to the data provider and provides connectivity to clients. Process service Generates the reports that are created and queued by the Management Reporter client.

Let’s look at the income statement - default report, So I have a couple parameter fields we need to change before we can generate our report. Please prefer below picture After we click **generate** button, Financial will be generated on current web browser we can see here by the report date. So, on our income statement, we have all the usual fields here. We have total revenues, gross profit, total operating experiences, net operating income and net income.

Conclusion Row, Column, Tree, Report definitions work essentially the same as they did in Dynamics AX 2012. I can still use row, column, and tree definitions with multiple reports, and options for the Report definition tabs. Here are some of the functions that are not available in Financial Reporting for Dynamics 365 for Operations: Publishing/distributing reports to SharePoint and/or SharePoint Online locations is not available. Report Viewer/Library has been removed. Import data from an Excel file is not available. XBRL (extensible Business Reporting Language) is no longer available. Comments are not currently available in the web client. Running a consolidation between companies in different instances of AX is not available. The Wizard has been removed. Management Reporter includes direct integration with the Microsoft Dynamics AX general ledger so that there is no need to create a custom connection to the data source. Nevertheless, with custom reporting structures, ledger accounts, and dimensions mapping, creation and the capabilities to publish reports to multiple channels and formats from the desktop, and embedding transactional and analytical reports into a customizable dashboard, Financial Reporting in Dynamics 365 For Operation is all set to simplify the financial reporting process, providing instant insight into your financials.

In this article, I will use a “House (like the houses we live in) “as a real-time example for easy understanding of OOP Concept in C#.

Class Class is a like a Blueprint. Blueprint is outline drawing of our actual plan. For example if we plan to build our new house, the Engineer will explain our new house plan with a blue print as shown in the image below. Once we finalized the plan the engineer will start building the house with same plan. Same like blueprint class is an outline of program. Using the class we can write our own method and declare the variables and using the objects we can access the class Method and Variables. The class will be complete with Variables, Methods and Objects. For more easy understanding of OOP with real world example here I have explained a class with House. We can imagine a House as an example for a Class. In a house, we will have rooms like living room, bedroom, kitchen and items like TV, fridge etc. House owner can access and use all the rooms and rooms’ items. Same like this in a Class will have a group of Methods and Variables. Rooms and Rooms’items are example for Methods and Variables. So now, we have a complete house with all rooms and rooms’items. House owner can access and use all the rooms and Rooms’ Items. To access and use a Class, methods and variables here we use Objects. Objects are instance of a class. We will see details about objects in the next section. What will happen if there are no rooms and items in a House? It will be empty and no one can use the house until it has all the rooms and Items. See the below image as an example for the empty house. Now this empty house is a Class. So what is the use of a Class without Methods and variable. Now let’s see an example for a Complete House with Rooms and items. So here, we have a complete house. Similarly, the Class will be complete with group of Variables, Methods and Objects. We can see details of all this in next sections of this article. Class and objects are the base concept of OOP – Object Oriented Programming. Class should be started with the Keyword class and next we give the name for our class we can give any meaning full name as Class Name, next we will have the Open and close brackets. using System; public class ClassA { } ","date":"April 11, 2017","objectID":"/2017-04-10-oops_concept/:0:1","tags":["C#","OOP","Object-oriented programming","Class","method"],"title":"Basic C# OOP Concept","uri":"/2017-04-10-oops_concept/"},{"categories":["Learn"],"content":"2. Object As we have already seen that, House Owner will access and use all the Rooms of the House and its Items. Similarly, to access all Class Method and Variable we use Objects. We can create one or many object for a same Class. Example we can say for a house there might be one or many owners. objHouseOwner is the Object for a class which will be used to access all variable and Method of a class. namespace ConsoleApplication1 { class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { Program pro = new Program(); } } } ","date":"April 11, 2017","objectID":"/2017-04-10-oops_concept/:0:2","tags":["C#","OOP","Object-oriented programming","Class","method"],"title":"Basic C# OOP Concept","uri":"/2017-04-10-oops_concept/"},{"categories":["Learn"],"content":"3. Variable Variables are used to store our value. Our value can be numeric or characters for example to store a Phone no we can use int type variable and to store our name we can use string type variable with name for each variable. Variables can be local or Global. For Example, we can say if we buy a new TV , TV Service man will come and setup the TV in our home. He will give his contact number for future contacts. Usually what we do is take a memo paper and write his contact number and keep it in a common place or in a wallet of ours. If we keep the memo in a Common place everyone who is visiting our house can see that contact number. Global or public variables are similar to this. If we declared the variable as Global, All the Methods inside the class can access the variable. If we store the memo Only in our wallet, we can see the contact number. Local or private variables are similar to this. Syntax for variable: Access-Modifiers Data-Type Variable-Name By default the Access-Modifiers are by private, we can also use public to variable. Example of Variable: namespace ConsoleApplication1 { // Example Program class ShanuHouseClass { public int noOfTV = 0; private Boolean doYouHaveTV = true; protected String yourTVName = \"SAMSUNG\"; static void Main(string[] args) { ShanuHouseClass objHouseOwner = new ShanuHouseClass(); Console.WriteLine(\"You Have total \" + objHouseOwner.noOfTV + \" no of TV :\"); Console.WriteLine(\"Your TV Name is :\" + objHouseOwner.yourTVName); Console.ReadLine(); } } } In Above example program I have declared two variables inside a class. In main method I have created object for class. Here we can see using the object we can access the variable of a class and display the output. Main Method is the default Method of C#, where every console and windows application will start the program execution, In the Main Method, we can declare the Object for the class and use the object, and we can access all variables and Methods of a Class. For example, we can say there will be entrance gate for every house. Using the entrance gate we can enter inside our house. Similarly, to run our program there should be some default program execution starting Method. Main method will be useful in this program execution starting point. Whenever we run our C# Console or windows application, first the Main method will be executed .From the main method we can create an object for our other classes and call their Methods.

Method or Functions Method is a group of code statement .Now here we can see the above example program with method. class ShanuHouseClass { public int noOfTV = 2; private Boolean doYouHaveTV = true; protected String yourTVName = \"SAMSUNG\"; public void myFirstMethod() { Console.WriteLine(\"You Have total \" + noOfTV + \"no of TV :\"); Console.WriteLine(\"Your TV Name is :\" + yourTVName); Console.ReadLine(); } } class a { static void Main(string[] args) { ShanuHouseClass a = new ShanuHouseClass(); a.myFirstMethod(); } } Most of developers were wondering about what is the difference between the Method and Function, both Methods and Functions are the same. Here in my article, I will use Method instead of functions. However, there is one difference in Methods and Functions, In OOP Languages like C#, Java etc. We use the term Method while the non-OOP programming like C etc. we use the term Function. What is the use of Methods? Another real-time example let’s take our mobile phone, we can say as we have Mobile phone and store many Songs in it. However, we always like to listen to the selected songs. It will be boring and hard for us to select our favorite song every time and play it. Instead of doing the same work repeatedly, we use the playlist. In playlist, we can add all-favorite songs of ours. Just click on the playlist of our collections and listen to the music. This will make our work easier and we don’t need to do the same thing again and again. Methods are used like a playlist where we can write all our repeated code in one Method and just call the method wherever we needed. In a house, there might be one big room or multiple rooms but each room will have different facilities, similarly in a class we can write one or multiple Methods. In a house, there might be two or three Bedrooms. Here the room name is Bedroom, but each bedroom can be different by size, color etc. This means same Rooms with different type. Similarly, in a class we can create more than one method with the same name but different parameter. In OOP it’s called as Polymorphism we can see details about Polymorphism later on in this article. Syntax for the Functions Access-Modifiers Return-Type Method-Name (Parameter-List) Access-Modifiers: We will see more details about this Topic later on. Return-Type: If our Method returns any value then we use the return Type with any Data Type as String, int etc., if our Method does not return any value then we use the type “Void”. Method-Name: Here we give our Name for every Method, which we create Parameter-List: Parameter-List or Arguments, which we pass to the function. Here is an example of Method: Method with Void Type: Void is a keyword which will not return any data from the Method, for example we can see the below Method with void Type, here in this method we display all our output using the Console.WriteLine and have used the Console.ReadLine()); to get the Input. This Method has all Input and Output Operation but this method don’t return any value. // Function with void and no parameter -- here void means no return type public void veranda() { Console.WriteLine(\"Welcome to Veranda\"); Console.WriteLine(\"How Many Chairs Do you have in your Veranda\"); NoofChair = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine()); Console.WriteLine(\"I have total \" + NoofChair + \" Chairs in my Veranda\"); } Method with Return Type: Method with return type will return some result, which can be used in our program, for example, here we have Method TVNAME with return Type as String. We can say in our home we might have a TV in our LivingROOM and in the parent’s bedroom and also in kids bedroom .We might have different TV brand in each room, suppose if we want to know each room TV Brand Name then we need to enter the same code 3 times. Instead of writing the same code again, we can use a method with Return Type. // Function with Return type as String public string TVNAME() { String YOURTVName; Console.WriteLine(\"Enter Your TV Brand NAME\"); YOURTVName = Co","date":"April 11, 2017","objectID":"/2017-04-10-oops_concept/:0:4","tags":["C#","OOP","Object-oriented programming","Class","method"],"title":"Basic C# OOP Concept","uri":"/2017-04-10-oops_concept/"},{"categories":["Learn"],"content":"5. Access Modifiers Access Modifiers are nothing but the Usage and Limitation of our type like variable, Methods and Class. For Example we can say it as a security limit. This six are the basic Access modifiers which we used in our C# Class/method and in Variables. Private Let’s take our House Example .We will have a Security Guard in House, His duty is till the Entrance of the house. He cannot go inside the house and access all the things. In this case we can create a SecurityGuardClass and declare the variable and method for Security as private . Public House Owners are public to the class where they can access all classes related to the House. They have no restrictions to access their house. Internal Access limit of variable or method is within a project. For example let’s consider in our project we have more than one class and we have declared a variable as internal in one class. Let’s see an example program for internal variable. class Modifiers { public class sampleInternalClass { internal String myInternal = \"Iam Internal Variable\"; } class ShanuHouseClass { int noOfTV = 2; public String yourTVName = \"SAMSUNG\"; public void myFirstMethod() { Console.WriteLine(\"You Have total \" + noOfTV + \"no of TV :\"); Console.WriteLine(\"Your TV Name is :\" + yourTVName); } static void Main(string[] args) { ShanuHouseClass objHouseOwner = new ShanuHouseClass(); objHouseOwner.myFirstMethod(); sampleInternalClass intObj = new sampleInternalClass(); Console.WriteLine(\"Internal Variable Example :\" + intObj.myInternal); Console.ReadLine(); } } } Protected Only the main class and derived class can have access of protected variable or method. For example servants and Guests are example for the Protected. For Example Servants can go to all room and do cleaning and other activates. However, they have limitations of access in the house, as they cannot take rest in a bed of house owner. Protected Internal Protected Internal variable or Method has limitation with in a project of class or Derived class. Here is a sample program for Protect Internal Variable .In this example I have used the Inheritance .we will see in detail about Inheritance more detail in this article. public class sampleProtectedInternalClass { protected internal String myprotectedInternal = \"Iam Protected Internal Variable\"; public void protectedInternalMethod() { Console.WriteLine(\"Protected Internal Variable Example :\" + myprotectedInternal); } } public class derivedClass : sampleProtectedInternalClass { public void derivedprotectedInternal() { Console.WriteLine(\"Derived Protected Internal Variable Example :\" + myprotectedInternal); } } class ShanuHouseClass { int noOfTV = 2; public String yourTVName = \"SAMSUNG\"; public void myFirstMethod() { Console.WriteLine(\"You Have total \" + noOfTV + \"no of TV :\"); Console.WriteLine(\"Your TV Name is :\" + yourTVName); } static void Main(string[] args) { ShanuHouseClass objHouseOwner = new ShanuHouseClass(); objHouseOwner.myFirstMethod(); sampleProtectedInternalClass intObj = new sampleProtectedInternalClass(); intObj.protectedInternalMethod(); derivedClass proIntObj = new derivedClass(); proIntObj.derivedprotectedInternal(); Console.ReadLine(); } } The main and major things we need to know in OOP concept are Encapsulation, Abstraction,Polymorphism and Inheritance. We will discuss them in detail in this article.

Encapsulation Encapsulation is to hide the member or variable to outside class. In our house example, I have already told that House security guard limitation is till the entrance of the house. The security guard doesn’t need to know about what is happening inside the house. Therefore, the House Owner will hide all the happenings to Security guard for more safety. The hiding and limitation are called as Encapsulation. For example, we have two Classes the first one is Houseclass and the other class as houseSecurityClass. Here we can see all the variables are wrap into a class where houseSecurityClass is set as public, so the Houseclass can access that, but houseClass has both Public and private variable where the private variable of a class cannot be accessed outside of the class. //Encapsulation in OOP public class houseSecurityClass { public int noofSecurity; public String SecurityName = String.Empty; } public class Houseclass { private int noofLockerinHosue = 2; public string OwnerName = String.Empty; } ","date":"April 11, 2017","objectID":"/2017-04-10-oops_concept/:0:6","tags":["C#","OOP","Object-oriented programming","Class","method"],"title":"Basic C# OOP Concept","uri":"/2017-04-10-oops_concept/"},{"categories":["Learn"],"content":"7. Abstraction Abstraction is to show and share some common information to the user. Let’s take our House example, in our house we will have servant, servants can go to all rooms and do cleaning and other works. The house owner can give full rights or some partial rights to the servant for accessing his house. Here we can see an example program as private declared variables and Methods are not shared with servant but the public variable and Methods are shared with servant. public class HouseServerntClass { private int SaftyLoackerKeyNo = 10001; public String roomCleanInstructions = \"Clean All rooms\"; private void saftyNos() { Console.WriteLine(\"My SaftyLoackerKeyNo is\" + SaftyLoackerKeyNo); } public void roomCleanInstruction() { Console.WriteLine(roomCleanInstructions); } static void Main(string[] agrs) { HouseServerntClass a = new HouseServerntClass(); a.saftyNos(); a.roomCleanInstruction(); Console.ReadLine(); } } ","date":"April 11, 2017","objectID":"/2017-04-10-oops_concept/:0:7","tags":["C#","OOP","Object-oriented programming","Class","method"],"title":"Basic C# OOP Concept","uri":"/2017-04-10-oops_concept/"},{"categories":["Learn"],"content":"8. Inheritance Inheritance is used to reuse the code. In Protected Internal Access modifier section we have already seen an example program for Inheritance. Inheritance is nothing but accessing and using all base class variable and methods in the Derived Class. Inheritance can be Single level Inheritance With one Base class and one derived Class for example. public class baseClass { private void privateMethod() { Console.WriteLine(\"private Method\"); } public void publicMethod() { Console.WriteLine(\"This Method Shared\"); } } public class DerivedClass : baseClass { static void Main(string[] args) { DerivedClass obj = new DerivedClass(); obj.publicMethod(); //This will be error as private method can not be accessed in Derived Class obj.privateMethod(); } } The Error is: Some time users might be not clear of what Base class is and what Derived class is. Base class is the super class and derived class is the classes which inherit the base class. Here we can see a simple Inheritance where the base class is the GuestVist and derived class is the HouseOwnerClass. Here HouseOwnerClass class inherits the base class of GuestVist Multi level Inheritance With more than one Derived Class for example. Here we can see an example first base class is derived in DerivedClass1 and then the DerivedClass1 is derived in DerivedClass2 .Now from DerivedClass2 we can access both baseClass and DerivedClass1 variable and methods. public class baseClass { private void privateMethod() { Console.WriteLine(\"private Method\"); } public void publicMethod() { Console.WriteLine(\"This Method Shared\"); } } public class DerivedClass1 : baseClass { public void DerivedClass1() { Console.WriteLine(\"Derived Class 1\"); } } public class DerivedClass2 : DerivedClass1 { static void Main(string[] args) { DerivedClass2 obj = new DerivedClass2(); obj.publicMethod(); obj.DerivedClass1(); //This will be error as private method can not be accessed in Derived Class //obj.privateMethod(); } } Multiple Inheritance Will the .Net Support Multiple Inheritance? The Answer to this Question is No. In C #, it’s not possible to write a Multiple Inheritance using Class. What is Multiple Inheritance? Multiple Inheritance is nothing but we can have more than one class and we can inherit both Classes in our derived class. What will happen if I write a Multiple Class Inheritance Using C#? Let’s take our example House .Here we have the derived Class as HouseOwnerClass and have Two More classes as GuestVist and FriendsandRelationsClass. Now suppose for our house both Guest and Friend have visited. For this, we write above three classes and inherit the two classes in our derived class. When I write the Multiple Inheritance in C #, it will display the warning message during our code and execute our program. See the below image which shows the Warning error message while I write Multiple Inheritance. * Then how can we use the Multiple Inheritance Interface will be used for Multiple Inheritance.

Polymorphism Ploy means more than one form. In the beginning of the Article at Method Section, we have already seen an example of Polymorphism. Same method name with different parameter is an example for the polymorphism. Method Overloading and Method Overriding will be used in polymorphism. Polymorphism have two types of execution one is Compile Time Polymorphism and the other one is called the Run time Polymorphism. Method Overloading Method overloading are nothing but same Method name will be used for more than one method with different Argument. Here is an example program for the Method Overloading. As we can see here Method name BedRoom has been used for two Method but the parameter for both methods are different. class HouseOwnerClass { //Function with parameter public void BedRoom(String nameandColor) { Console.WriteLine(nameandColor); } // Same Function Name with Different Paramenter public void BedRoom(String MemberName, String Color) { Console.WriteLine(MemberName + \" Like \" + Color + \" Color\"); } static void Main(string[] args) { HouseOwnerClass objHouseOwner = new HouseOwnerClass(); objHouseOwner.BedRoom(\"My Name is Shanu I like Lavender color\"); objHouseOwner.BedRoom(\"My Name is Afraz I like Light Blue color\"); objHouseOwner.BedRoom(\"SHANU\", \"Lavender\"); Console.ReadLine(); } } Method Overriding The difference between the Method Overloading and Overriding are.In Method Overloading we will have same method name with different argument. In Method Overriding we will have same Method Name same Argument and same type but method overriding can only be used in the derived class, Method Overriding cannot be done in the same class. We will see how Method Overriding can be used in Abstract Method, Virtual Method and in Sealed Method kindly refer to that section in this article.

Abstract Class/Method Abstract Class: Abstract class will have a keyword abstract. The Abstract class will be as a super class for all our class. Abstract class cannot be accessed by an object, which means we cannot create an object for an abstract class. What will happen when we create an object for an Abstract Class? Here we can see an error warning message as “An instance of an abstract class cannot be created” when I try to create an object for my abstract class. Abstract class can have both Abstract Method and normal Method. In Abstract Class at least one Abstract Method should be declared. In addition, derived class should override the abstract method. To access the abstract method we should use the “override” keyword in our derived class. What will happen if we create an abstract method but which is not override in derived class? Here we can see an abstract class has an abstract method, But the abstract method is not override in the derived class. See the below image for the warning message displaying as class must implement the abstract member. Here we can see an example of Abstract Class and for Abstract Method in detail. In this example, we can see an abstract class, which has normal Method and Abstract Method. Abstract Methods; do not have body part in Abstract Class, which means we can only declare an Abstract Method at Abstract Class, There should be minimum one Abstract Method in an Abstract Class. public abstract class GuestVist { public void Guestwelcomemessage() { Console.WriteLine(\"Welcome to our AbstractHome\"); } public void GuestName() { Console.WriteLine(\"Guest name is: Abstract\"); } public abstract void purposeofVisit(); } // derived class to inherit the abstract class public class A : GuestVist { public override void purposeofVisit() { Console.WriteLine(\"Abstract just came for a Meetup and spend some time \"); } static void Main(string[] args) { A objHouse = new A(); objHouse.purposeofVisit(); objHouse.Guestwelcomemessage(); objHouse.GuestName(); Console.ReadLine(); } } ","date":"April 11, 2017","objectID":"/2017-04-10-oops_concept/:0:10","tags":["C#","OOP","Object-oriented programming","Class","method"],"title":"Basic C# OOP Concept","uri":"/2017-04-10-oops_concept/"},{"categories":["Learn"],"content":"11. Virtual Class/Method Virtual method is very useful in our day-to-day programming. What is virtual Method and what is the use of Virtual Method? Take our House example one guest confirms, as today total five persons will visit your home. For this, we write a function as message display as five Guest visiting our home. Once Guest visits, we see their total 20 persons have visited. In Some cases it might be increase or decrease we will come to know when they reach us. In that case, the guest will be as a Separate Class and House will be as separate class. Without changing the message in Guest class how can we change the data in our Derived class? What is the Difference between Abstract Method and Virtual Method? Both similarities use the override keyword. Abstract Method can only be declared in Abstract Class, which means no body part for abstract method in Abstract class. However, for virtual it can have body part. See the example program below. Here we have both Abstract Method and Virtual Method. In Abstract class, the virtual method says as total five guests but in the derived Class program, the message was override as 20 guests. See the final output in below. Guess what will be displayed for Virtual Method? Will the result be 5 Guests or 20 Guests check for the output below the program. public abstract class GuestVist { public abstract void purposeofVisit(); // Abstract Method public virtual void NoofGuestwillvisit() // Virtual Method { Console.WriteLine(\"Total 5 Guest will Visit your Home\"); } } class AbstractHouseClass : GuestVist { public override void purposeofVisit() // Abstract method Override { Console.WriteLine(\"Abstract just for a Meetup and spend some time \"); } public override void NoofGuestwillvisit() // Virtual method override { Console.WriteLine(\"Total 20 Guest Visited our Home\"); } static void Main(string[] args) { AbstractHouseClass objHouse = new AbstractHouseClass(); objHouse.purposeofVisit(); objHouse.NoofGuestwillvisit(); Console.ReadLine(); } } ","date":"April 11, 2017","objectID":"/2017-04-10-oops_concept/:0:11","tags":["C#","OOP","Object-oriented programming","Class","method"],"title":"Basic C# OOP Concept","uri":"/2017-04-10-oops_concept/"},{"categories":["Learn"],"content":"12. Sealed Class/Method Sealed Class: As name says this class cannot be inherited by other classes. Take our House Example. In a house, the Houseowner can have a secret room, as might be official or financial rooms. The owner don’t want others to access his official room. The sealed class will be useful in those cases. Sealed class can be declared using the keyword Sealed. If one class is declared as Sealed, it cannot be inherited in other derived classes. What will happen when we inherit sealed class in our derived class? Let’s see an example when I try to inherit my sealed class from my derived class. It shows me the below warning message.

Static Class/Method We have already learned about what is Sealed Class in this Article; now let’s see what are Static Class and Static Method. Both Static and Sealed Class cannot be inherited. What is the Difference between Static Class and Sealed Class? We can create an Object (instance) for the Sealed Class, we can see in my sealed class section I have created a sample Sealed class and in Main Method I have created an object to access the sealed Class. And in a Sealed Class both Static and non-Static methods can be written. But for a Static Class it’s not possible to create an Object. In Static Class only Static members are allowed which means in a static Class it’s not possible to write non-static method. We can say our main method as an example for the Static method. When we create a console application in c# we can see each class will have a default main method. In my article I have explained that when an Console or Windows application start execute first the main method will be executed .There is no need to create an object for the main method since it was been declared as a static method. static void Main(string[] args) Another interesting one in Static class is that memory will be allocated for all static variable and methods during execution but for the non static variable and methods memory will be allocated only when the object for the class are created. Let’s take our same sealed class Example for our static Class and method. What will happen when we inherit Static class in our derived class? Let’s see an example when I try to inherit my static class from my derived class. It shows me the below warning message. What will happen when we declare non-Static method in a Static class? Let’s see an example when I try to create a non-Static method at my Static Class. What will happen when we create an object for the Static class? Let’s see an example when I try to create an object for my Static Class. When we run the program we get the error message as Can not create an instance of a static class How to call the Static Class Method and variable without creating the Object? It’s simple just we can use the ClassName.Variable or Method Name for example OwnerofficialRoom.AllMyPersonalItems(); See the below example with Static class public static class OwnerofficialRoom { public static void AllMyPersonalItems() { Console.WriteLine(\"All Items in this rooms are personal to me no one else can access or inherit me\"); } } class HouseStaticClass { static void Main(string[] args) { OwnerofficialRoom.AllMyPersonalItems(); Console.ReadLine(); } } Is that possible to create a Static Method in non-Static Class? The answer is yes. We can create a Static Method to the non Static class. No need to create an object to access the static method in non-static class. We can directly use the class name to access the Static method. See the below example with Static method in non-static Class. public class OwnerofficialRoom { public static void AllMyPersonalItems() { Console.WriteLine(\"No need to create object for me just use my class name to access me :)\"); } public void non_staticMethod() { Console.WriteLine(\"You need to create an Object to Access Me :(\"); } } class StaticmethodClass { static void Main(string[] args) { // for statci method no need to create object just call directly using the classname. OwnerofficialRoom.AllMyPersonalItems(); // for non-static method need to create object to access the method. OwnerofficialRoom obj = new OwnerofficialRoom(); obj.non_staticMethod(); Console.ReadLine(); } } ","date":"April 11, 2017","objectID":"/2017-04-10-oops_concept/:0:13","tags":["C#","OOP","Object-oriented programming","Class","method"],"title":"Basic C# OOP Concept","uri":"/2017-04-10-oops_concept/"},{"categories":["Learn"],"content":"14. Interface Interface is same like abstract class but in Interface we will have only method declaration but in abstract class we can have both method declaration and method definition .Methods of Interface must be implemented in a implementing class. See the below Example program for an Interface. All the methods of Interface have been implemented in the class. As I have already told you that c# don’t support multiple inheritance for using multiple inheritance we can use Interface. This below program is an example for multiple inheritance using Interface. interface GuestInterface { void GuestWelcomeMessage(); void NoofGuestes(); } interface FriendsandRelationsInterface { void friendwelcomemessage(); void FriendName();} class HouseOwnerClass : GuestInterface, FriendsandRelationsInterface { public void GuestWelcomeMessage() { Console.WriteLine(\"All guests are well come to our home\"); } public void NoofGuestes() { Console.WriteLine(\"Total 15 Guestes has visited\"); } public void friendwelcomemessage() { Console.WriteLine(\"Welcome to our Home\"); } public void FriendName() { Console.WriteLine(\"Friend name is: Afraz\"); } static void Main(string[] args) { HouseOwnerClass obj = new HouseOwnerClass(); obj.GuestWelcomeMessage(); obj.NoofGuestes(); obj.friendwelcomemessage(); obj.FriendName(); Console.ReadLine(); } } In some cases we need to have certain methods which will be used in many derived classes. Each derived can implement different functionality for those Methods. In These cases, we can use the Interface. We can say our Guest and house example. For Guest the Welcome Message and No of Guest Function are common, but it will be different for different owners in the same house, Guest might a fathers guest, Mothers Guest, Children’s Guest or Family Guest. Each guest can have different welcome message subject, but the functions are same as Message .let’s consider now Father is a Class, Mother is a class and Children are one Class. Both guestWelcome Message and Noofguest method are same for all. In this case, we can create an Interface and declare both methods in the Interface. All father, mother and Children Classes can inherit the interface and write their own method details. Interface is similar to Abstract class but the major difference between the Abstract Class and the Interface are .In Abstract Class there can be both Abstract Method and Non Abstract methods .But in Interface all methods are abstract by default which means there is no non Abstract type method in the Interface. All the Methods declared in Interface should be override in the derived class. What will happen when non-abstract methods with body part are declared in an Interface? It will display the warning message as unexpected modifier in Access modifier part and Unexpected Method body error warning at message Body. This article repost from here under markdown format.

Using methods from this class allow you to be very precise about what dates you want to use in reports or for filtering your data. Let’s say you have a report that you always want to run to see orders with shipping dates of the next day. It is possible to do so by using one of the methods from the SysQueryRangeUtil. The use of the letter ’t’ will work for today’s date, but when you try to add days to it, it doesn’t work in reports. Instead, I will use the currentdate() method and add 1 to it. All methods \u0026 expressions must be surrounded by parentheses as shown below. Filtering the requested ship dates in an AX query for tomorrow (current day() + 1) On any form with a grid, you filter your data by pressing Ctrl+G. If I were to want to see open customer invoices from the last 90 days, I would filter my open customer invoices form and use the method (dayRange(-90,0)). The first number represents how many months backward from this month, and the second represents how many months forward. The same sorts of things can be done for the monthRange(), yearRange(), and dateRange() methods. The best part about this is that you can of course save these filters to create views that you might use on a daily basis. If you are creating your query ranges in code, these methods can also be utilized whenever you are setting them. Definitely be sure to check out the SysQueryRangeUtil class as there are many more methods to use. Here is some methods you can use: currentCustomerAccount() currentVendorAccount() currentUserId() currentDate() dateRange() day() dayRange() greaterThanDate() greaterThanUtcDate() greaterThanUtcNow() lessthanDate() lessthanUtcDate() lessthanUtcNow() monthRange() yearRange() for example: (dayRange(-30,0)) – Results in a date range for the last 30 days: \"26-01-2017\"..\"25-02-2017\" (day(-1)) – Results in yesterday's date: 24-02-2017 (day(0)) – Results in today's date: 25-02-2017 (day(1)) – Results in tomorrow's date: 26-02-2017 (greaterThanDate(2)) – Results in every date after today plus 2: \u003e 27-02-2017 (lessThanDate(-1)) – Results in every date of today minus 1: \u003c 24-02-2017 (monthRange(0,2)) – Results in first day till the last day of the month's choosen (0 = current month): \"01-02-2017\"..\"30-04-2017\" (yearRange(-1,-1)) – Results in first day till the last day of the chosen year: \"01-01-2017\"..\"31-12-2017\" Thank you for reading!

Variants: To create a product variant, you must define at least one product dimension for a product master. You can also rename dimensions.

User-defined class types are dynamically composed from application model layers and Microsoft Dynamics AX runtime class types exposed in the system API. Interface types are type specifications and can’t be instantiated in the Microsoft Dynamics AX runtime. Class types can, however, implement interfaces. Variables declared as reference types contain references to objects that the Microsoft Dynamics AX runtime instantiates from dynamically composed types defined in the application model layering system and from types exposed in the system API. The Microsoft Dynamics AX runtime also performs memory deallocation (garbage collection) for these objects when they are no longer referenced. Reference variables declared as record types reference objects that the Microsoft Dynamics AX runtime instantiates automatically. Class type objects are programmatically instantiated using the new operator.

A document service is composed of the following components: Document query : This is a query that is created in the Application Object Tree (AOT) and contains all the tables that are related to the business object that you want to expose. Based on this query, the Document Service Generation Wizard can be used to generate the other artifacts that make up the document service. Table AxBC classes : An AxBC class is a wrapper for a table and contains business logic that is needed for Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations. Document class : The purpose of the document class is to contain business logic that is associated with the creation and modification of the business entity itself. For example, the AxdCustomer class could contain logic to handle party information of a customer. Document service class : This is the actual service implementation class and extends the AifDocumentService class. This class implements the service operations that are published through the service contract. When creating document services, developers need to make sure that the business object is mapped correctly to the document query. The document services framework will handle all other things such as the serialization and deserialization of XML, date effectiveness, and so on. Document services can be deployed using the integration ports and all available adapters can be used. Custom services Custom services were already available in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009, but support for Extended Data Types(EDTs) was limited, which resulted in developers having to provide custom serialization and deserialization logic. Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 introduces the concept of attributes. Attributes provide a way to specify metadata about classes and methods. Two of these attributes are used when creating data contracts: the DataContractAttribute and DataMemberAttribute attributes. The ‘DataContractAttribute’ attribute is used to define that a class is a data contract. The’DataMemberAttribute’ attribute is added to methods of data contracts that represent data members that have to be exposed. This way of defining data contracts is very similar to other programming languages such as C#. Support for more complex data types such as collections and tables has been added so that these types can be serialized and deserialized without developers having to provide the logic themselves. In a typical custom service you will find the following components: Service contract : A service contract is an X++ class that contains methods with the SysEntryPointAttribute attribute. This identifies methods that will result in a service operation contract when the service is exposed. Data contracts : A data contract is an X++ class that is attributed with the DataContractAttribute attribute. It contains parameter methods that will be attributed as data members for each member variable that needs to be part of the data contract. Custom services can be deployed using the integration ports and any available adapter can be used. System services These services are new since the release of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012. The main difference between these services and the previous two types is that they are not customizable and are not mapped to a query or X++ code. They are not customizable because they are written by Microsoft in managed code. One exception is the user session service, which is written in X++ code but is generally considered as a system service. There are three system services available for use in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012: the query service, the metadata service, and the user session service. Query service The query service provides the means to run queries of the following three types: Static queries defined in the AOT. User-defined queries by using the QueryMetaData class in the service. Dynamic queries that are written in X++ ","date":"November 10, 2016","objectID":"/2016-11-10-types-services-microsoft-dynamics-ax-2012/:0:0","tags":["aif","xpp","aos"],"title":"Types of services in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012","uri":"/2016-11-10-types-services-microsoft-dynamics-ax-2012/"},{"categories":["AX 2012","Data"],"content":"SUMMARY Tool can be used for two different purposes.

The tool minimally changes data during the import process. The only data the tool changes are the entity IDs (IDs related to table, field, etc.) that are stored as data and that could change with each deployment.

The model store replaces the AOD files used in previous releases of Microsoft Dynamics AX. It can be managed through the AXUtil command line utility, or by using Windows PowerShell. The baseline model store database holds model store tables for the previous version of metadata. Use it only during an upgrade. The baseline model store is similar to the old folder in previous releases of Microsoft Dynamics AX. Thank you for reading.

The client never accesses the database or metadata directly. AOS sends the application objects and data to the client. The data layer that the client uses is based on data sources that are specified in metadata for forms and queries. In addition, any X++ code that is required to retrieve data can use the built-in language support to query and adjust data. The client uses a report Web Part to interact with the report server. By calling the web services that are exposed by the report server, the report control in the Web Part displays information that is contained in Reporting Services reports. These reports can include either transnational data from the Microsoft Dynamics AX application or OLAP cubes from Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services. Cubes provide business analytic and key performance indicators (KPIs). The client provides workflow forms, alerts, and controls so that users can participate in the business process by using the Workflow system. The Workflow system is a Microsoft Dynamics AX component that enables workflow processes by using Windows Communication Foundation classes. The client provides a Help viewer, which is an application that displays context-sensitive Help topics. The Help topics are retrieved from a Help server that is located on-premises. The client also provides Role Centers, or role-based home pages, for users. Role Centers provide role-specific tasks, activities, alerts, reports, and business intelligence that help users increase their productivity. To interact with the Role Centers that are provided by Enterprise Portal and hosted on Internet Information Services (IIS), the client uses a browser control.

Internet-based external applications and clients access the AX services through Internet Information Services (IIS). IIS routes the incoming requests for AX services to AOS. All services requests, regardless of their origin, are handled by the WCF runtime that is hosted on AOS. The AIF request preprocessor, if it is configured, can intercept the inbound request messages for custom preprocessing, such as message transforms or value substitutions. The AX service invokes the necessary business logic to process the inbound request message. Similarly, the AIF response postprocessor, if it is configured, can intercept the outbound response messages for custom post-processing, such as message transforms or value substitutions.

I mean, programming, and lovin’ it. Even if I’m not so good. helloworld I’ve heard a thousand of guys telling stories like: “When I was twelve my parents bought me my first computer and I started learning on my own.” or “I won a programming contest when I was in highschool”. Great. Well done. I’ve never noticed about what coding was until I was eighteen, when I had to decide what to study at the University. Do you want to know what was I thinking about? First option: Computer Science. Second option: Arts (wtf?). Third option: Philosophy (WTF?). I’ve ever liked computers, yes, but I’d never thought I could do that amazing things with them. I also liked maths, puzzles, things that made my brain think hard and get fun at the same time. You know, quizes, enigmas, games… The conclusion was that I wanted to do something creative, where I could put my imagination on, where I could challenge myself in order to create new stuff. My first programming class was awful. I didn’t get nothing, and everyone seemed to be so cool on it, everyone with this big “Hello World” in their screens and a smile in their faces like ‘Yeah dude, I did it.”. I didn’t even know what to write down, or what was the teacher talking about. I was so frustrated, my first exam was… well, I don’t want to talk about my first exam. One day, I don’t know how, something changed. Suddenly, I realized what programming was. I really abstracted my mind, I looked at it from another perspective, and it came with me so clear and so beautiful and I can not explain with words what I felt. Was it easier from then? Not at all. In fact, I left Computer Science after the first year, with almost all the subjects passed, because there was still something that made me think I was not made for it. I was so lost, I didn’t know what to do with my life. I really liked programming, but there were so much thinks that seemed to be so far away from me. And I felt that everyone around me was going good on it, it was so frustrating that I couldn’t stand it anymore. Then, I decided I had to change my situation because there should be something out there waiting for me. I looked for other degrees in a lot of universities. It was. I do really love what I’m studying now, but the truth is that I think I’ve found my way. Actually, I will finish also Computer Science someday, but in a different place. And I’m still getting frustrated, of course, who doesn’t?, but I know I learned to love that frustration. Let me explain myself. Programming is that. Is try it out thousand of times. Is try to find a mistake between a million lines of code, it’s to abstract your mind to find an answer, it’s… beautiful. I know really good programmers that honestly, I think I’ll never reach out, I have not that brilliant brain. But I keep on trying it, I’m not the best, I just love what I do. Maybe this post is not just about programming, maybe is more about to find out what do you really love. Even if sometimes you hate it, or it makes you cry, or it makes you feel so stupid because you are not able to understand it, or if it makes you think there is a lot of people smarter than you doing the same thing better. Just… enjoy your time, fight for what you want, challenge yourself to go to the next step.

Instruments include graphite pencils, pen and ink, various kinds of paints, inked brushes, colored pencils, crayons, charcoal, chalk, pastels, various kinds of erasers, markers, styluses, and various metals (such as silverpoint). Digital drawing is the act of using a computer to draw. Common methods of digital drawing include a stylus or finger on a touchscreen device, stylus- or finger-to-touchpad, or in some cases, a mouse. There are many digital art programs and devices. A drawing instrument releases a small amount of material onto a surface, leaving a visible mark. The most common support for drawing is paper, although other materials, such as cardboard, wood, plastic, leather, canvas, and board, may be used. Temporary drawings may be made on a blackboard or whiteboard or indeed almost anything. The medium has been a popular and fundamental means of public expression throughout human history. It is one of the simplest and most efficient means of communicating visual ideas. The wide availability of drawing instruments makes drawing one of the most common artistic activities. In addition to its more artistic forms, drawing is frequently used in commercial illustration, animation, architecture, engineering and technical drawing. A quick, freehand drawing, usually not intended as a finished work, is sometimes called a sketch. An artist who practices or works in technical drawing may be called a drafter, draftsman or a draughtsman. Drawing is one of the oldest forms of human expression within the visual arts. It is generally concerned with the marking of lines and areas of tone onto paper/other material, where the accurate representation of the visual world is expressed upon a plane surface. Traditional drawings were monochrome, or at least had little colour, while modern colored-pencil drawings may approach or cross a boundary between drawing and painting. In Western terminology, drawing is distinct from painting, even though similar media often are employed in both tasks. Dry media, normally associated with drawing, such as chalk, may be used in pastel paintings. Drawing may be done with a liquid medium, applied with brushes or pens. Similar supports likewise can serve both: painting generally involves the application of liquid paint onto prepared canvas or panels, but sometimes an underdrawing is drawn first on that same support. Drawing is often exploratory, with considerable emphasis on observation, problem-solving and composition. Drawing is also regularly used in preparation for a painting, further obfuscating their distinction. Drawings created for these purposes are called studies. There are several categories of drawing, including figure drawing, cartooning, doodling, and freehand. There are also many drawing methods, such as line drawing, stippling, shading, the surrealist method of entopic graphomania (in which dots are made at the sites of impurities in a blank sheet of paper, and lines are then made between the dots), and tracing (drawing on a translucent paper, such as tracing paper, around the outline of preexisting shapes that show through the paper). A quick, unrefined drawing may be called a sketch. In fields outside art, technical drawings or plans of buildings, machinery, circuitry and other things are often called “drawings” even when they have been transferred to another medium by printing.

A license can be granted by a party to another party as an element of an agreement between those parties. A shorthand definition of a license is “an authorization to use licensed material.” In particular, a license may be issued by authorities, to allow an activity that would otherwise be forbidden. It may require paying a fee or proving a capability. The requirement may also serve to keep the authorities informed on a type of activity, and to give them the opportunity to set conditions and limitations. A licensor may grant a license under intellectual property laws to authorize a use (such as copying software or using a (patented) invention) to a licensee, sparing the licensee from a claim of infringement brought by the licensor. A license under intellectual property commonly has several components beyond the grant itself, including a term, territory, renewal provisions, and other limitations deemed vital to the licensor. Term: many licenses are valid for a particular length of time. This protects the licensor should the value of the license increase, or market conditions change. It also preserves enforceability by ensuring that no license extends beyond the term of the agreement. Territory: a license may stipulate what territory the rights pertain to. For example, a license with a territory limited to “North America” (Mexico/United States/Canada) would not permit a licensee any protection from actions for use in Japan. A shorthand definition of license is “a promise by the licensor not to sue the licensee”. That means without a license any use or exploitation of intellectual property by a third party would amount to copying or infringement. Such copying would be improper and could, by using the legal system, be stopped if the intellectual property owner wanted to do so. Intellectual property licensing plays a major role in business, academia and broadcasting. Business practices such as franchising, technology transfer, publication and character merchandising entirely depend on the licensing of intellectual property. Land licensing (proprietary licensing) and IP licensing form sub-branches of law born out of the interplay of general laws of contract and specific principles and statutory laws relating to these respective assets.
