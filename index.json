Usually, frameworks are shipped with a set of predefined functions and classes. When using Spring (Java) or Symfony (PHP) for example, programmers do not need to think about things such as persistence, routing and session management too much because the work is done by standardized framework components. Platform platform, on the other hand, provides both the hardware and the software tools needed to run an application – be it a standalone program or one which has been built on top of a framework. Mostly, it comes in the flavor of Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), meaning that the code-base of the platform software itself is not distributed or licensed.

This restriction helps guarantee that every method in the chain contributes to the result. In the current implementation of this restriction, the call to next must be in the first-level statements in the method body.” So as described in the article, the Chain Of Command in Dynamics 365 finance and operations is used to add the logic before or after a method of a class is invoked and the original method will always be executed due to the compulsory of the next statement. When doing some implementations, we found out that there is a tricky way to completely ignore the execution of the original method of the class that is extended. Please see below for more details: For example, I created a project and add a new runnable class named Alex: class Alex { public static void main(Args _args) { throw error (\"Hello World\"); } } When this class runs, a Hello World info message will be displayed in the FinOps UI. Then I used chain of command to create Alex_Extension class that extends this class and “override” the main method of the Alex’s class by putting the next call into another method and never call it like this: [ExtensionOf(classStr(Alex))] final class Alex_Extension { public static void main(Args _args) { //Implement something here info (\"Ok\"); void ignore() { next main(_args); } } } When I run the AlexExtension, the original main method of the Alex class will be ignored and only the additional block of code that I wrote in the AlexExtension class will be executed, so only the OK info will appear. Now we will try with a sample scenario from D365 Finance and Operation. In General Ledger Module, we have General journals form When you click the button for Journal Print, the menu item will be triggered and point to the controller name: LedgerJournalController with LedgerJournalController class and the report will be generated. I will use COC to “override” the main method of LedgerJournalController class by applying the method above: [ExtensionOf(classStr(LedgerJournalController))] final class Alex_LedgerJournalController_Extension { public static void main(Args _args) { info(\"ok\"); void ignore_first() { next main(_args); } } } Using this I will ignore the the main method of LedgerJournalController class and instead of generate the report, the result will be only the OK info line in the extension class: This is a little bit tricky because we still call next in our extension class as per the requirement of COC, but as we never call the method that “wrap” the next call so it will not be executed. You can try this to simply ignore or rewrite a method of a class in FinOps. Thank you for reading.

Business events can be consumed using Microsoft Flow and Azure messaging services, and we use endpoint to manage the destinations for sending business events to, Microsoft supports many endpoints: Azure Service Bus Queue, Azure Service Bus Topic, Azure Event Grid, Azure Event Hub, HTTPS, Microsoft Flow.

Key commands The Try command signifies the start of a block of code that you want to control with the X++ exception handling system. Any exceptions that are thrown in that block of code can be caught and handled accordingly. The block of code inside the Try statement must be contained between brackets ( { } ). Catch statements come after the block of code and define what code is executed when each exception is thrown. You do not have to define a catch statement for every possible exception; however, each try statement must have at least one catch statement. A Retry command tells the system to go back to the Try statement and attempt to execute the code again. Any data that was loaded before the Try command will remain as it was, but any data retrieved or modified after the Try statement will be refreshed. When a deadlock exception is thrown, all locks on tables that this process holds are released, which may allow the other process or processes that are also deadlocked to continue. By calling a retry, the process can attempt to update the record again and may now be able to complete. It is a best practice that a retry uses a counter so that the number of retries can be controlled, and a user does not become stuck in a loop.

Optimistic Concurrency Exceptions The optimistic concurrency check (OCC) is a performance enhancing function within Microsoft Dynamics 365 For Operation. It presumes that any record retrieved from the database is not updated until it is proven to be updated by the database. This means that fewer locks must be placed on records in the database. This allows for faster access for other users. This also means that one user can update a record after another user has retrieved it from the database. This can cause data inconsistency. If the second user then also tries to update the record, an UpdateConflict exception is thrown. The system does this by comparing the recVersion field on the record buffer at runtime and the actual record in the database. The recVersion field value is changed every time that an update is successfully made to a record. There are two main table update exceptions, UpdateConflict and DeadLock. An update conﬂict occurs due to the optimistic concurrency failing, whereas a deadlock is the classic database scenario where both transactions have each locked a table that the other needs. Update conﬂicts are normally handled within the insert, delete, and update methods of a table. The BOM table is a good example of this. You may also hard to find many examples where this has been used. We use this pattern only if we deem it to be required. The code within the table’s update method also updates other records, so it has been written to handle update conﬂicts. The following code is an example of how to handle the UpdateConflict exception that might be thrown. public void update() { #OCCRetryCount try { ttsbegin; // code that updates records in other tables super(); // do the update // other code that updates records in other tables ttscommit; } //Deadlock catch (Exception::Deadlock) { retry; } //UpdateConflict catch (Exception::UpdateConflict) { if (appl.ttsLevel() == 0) { if (xSession::currentRetryCount() \u003e= #RetryNum) { throw Exception::UpdateConflictNotRecovered; } else { retry; } } else { throw Exception::UpdateConflict; } } } If a conflict due to OCC occurs, the system throws the UpdateConflict exception and it is caught by the catch statement. The other new element here is ttsLevel. Since transactions can be nested, we do want the exception to falling through to the parent transaction if one exists. If ttsabort is issued (directly or due to a throwing error) at any level, the whole transaction will be rolled back; we can’t roll back just the level where the error is thrown. The code checks the current TTS level. If it is not Zero, in other words, it is still in a TTS transaction, it throws another UpdateConflict exception to the next Catch list of the next outer Try statement in scope. This continues until it is no longer inside a TTS transaction. We must make sure that when the code is retired, all data is refreshed. It is important that we don’t retry indefinitely, as this may cause the client to hang. To control this, we use xSession::currentRetryCount() to get the number of retries and check this against the #RetryNum macro. The macro defines the standard number of retries deemed appropriate by Microsoft, which is five. then the UpdateConflictNotRecovered exception is thrown. This means the whole transaction is aborted and stops retrying.

Also, if there is an error, we need to decide whether the user actually needs to know that an error occurred.

Management Report Components Some important components I want to mention here: Report Designer Create report building blocks that can be combined to define and generate a report. The report wizard guides less experienced users through the design process. Advanced users can create new report building blocks or modify existing building blocks to meet their requirements. Desktop Viewer Used to organize and view reports and supporting files. It also stores the report library. Web Viewer Displays Management Reporter reports in a web browser. The Web Viewer does not require an installation of Management Reporter server components. Report schedules A user can schedule a single report or a group of reports to generate regularly. Management Reporter database This SQL database stores the components, known as building blocks, which are used to generate reports. It also stores report definitions and previously generated reports.

Conclusion Row, Column, Tree, Report definitions work essentially the same as they did in Dynamics AX 2012. I can still use row, column, and tree definitions with multiple reports, and options for the Report definition tabs. Here are some of the functions that are not available in Financial Reporting for Dynamics 365 for Operations: Publishing/distributing reports to SharePoint and/or SharePoint Online locations is not available. Report Viewer/Library has been removed. Import data from an Excel file is not available. XBRL (extensible Business Reporting Language) is no longer available. Comments are not currently available in the web client. Running a consolidation between companies in different instances of AX is not available. The Wizard has been removed. Management Reporter includes direct integration with the Microsoft Dynamics AX general ledger so that there is no need to create a custom connection to the data source. Nevertheless, with custom reporting structures, ledger accounts, and dimensions mapping, creation and the capabilities to publish reports to multiple channels and formats from the desktop, and embedding transactional and analytical reports into a customizable dashboard, Financial Reporting in Dynamics 365 For Operation is all set to simplify the financial reporting process, providing instant insight into your financials.

In this article, I will use a “House (like the houses we live in) “as a real-time example for easy understanding of OOP Concept in C#.

Class Class is a like a Blueprint. Blueprint is outline drawing of our actual plan. For example if we plan to build our new house, the Engineer will explain our new house plan with a blue print as shown in the image below. Once we finalized the plan the engineer will start building the house with same plan. Same like blueprint class is an outline of program. Using the class we can write our own method and declare the variables and using the objects we can access the class Method and Variables. The class will be complete with Variables, Methods and Objects. For more easy understanding of OOP with real world example here I have explained a class with House. We can imagine a House as an example for a Class. In a house, we will have rooms like living room, bedroom, kitchen and items like TV, fridge etc. House owner can access and use all the rooms and rooms' items. Same like this in a Class will have a group of Methods and Variables. Rooms and Rooms’items are example for Methods and Variables. So now, we have a complete house with all rooms and rooms’items. House owner can access and use all the rooms and Rooms' Items. To access and use a Class, methods and variables here we use Objects. Objects are instance of a class. We will see details about objects in the next section. What will happen if there are no rooms and items in a House? It will be empty and no one can use the house until it has all the rooms and Items. See the below image as an example for the empty house. Now this empty house is a Class. So what is the use of a Class without Methods and variable. Now let’s see an example for a Complete House with Rooms and items. So here, we have a complete house. Similarly, the Class will be complete with group of Variables, Methods and Objects. We can see details of all this in next sections of this article. Class and objects are the base concept of OOP – Object Oriented Programming. Class should be started with the Keyword class and next we give the name for our class we can give any meaning full name as Class Name, next we will have the Open and close brackets. using System; public class ClassA { } ","date":"April 11, 2017","objectID":"/2017-04-10-oops_concept/:0:1","tags":["C#","OOP","Object-oriented programming","Class","method"],"title":"Basic C# OOP Concept","uri":"/2017-04-10-oops_concept/"},{"categories":["OOP"],"content":"2. Object As we have already seen that, House Owner will access and use all the Rooms of the House and its Items. Similarly, to access all Class Method and Variable we use Objects. We can create one or many object for a same Class. Example we can say for a house there might be one or many owners. objHouseOwner is the Object for a class which will be used to access all variable and Method of a class. namespace ConsoleApplication1 { class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { Program pro = new Program(); } } } ","date":"April 11, 2017","objectID":"/2017-04-10-oops_concept/:0:2","tags":["C#","OOP","Object-oriented programming","Class","method"],"title":"Basic C# OOP Concept","uri":"/2017-04-10-oops_concept/"},{"categories":["OOP"],"content":"3. Variable Variables are used to store our value. Our value can be numeric or characters for example to store a Phone no we can use int type variable and to store our name we can use string type variable with name for each variable. Variables can be local or Global. For Example, we can say if we buy a new TV , TV Service man will come and setup the TV in our home. He will give his contact number for future contacts. Usually what we do is take a memo paper and write his contact number and keep it in a common place or in a wallet of ours. If we keep the memo in a Common place everyone who is visiting our house can see that contact number. Global or public variables are similar to this. If we declared the variable as Global, All the Methods inside the class can access the variable. If we store the memo Only in our wallet, we can see the contact number. Local or private variables are similar to this. Syntax for variable: Access-Modifiers Data-Type Variable-Name By default the Access-Modifiers are by private, we can also use public to variable. Example of Variable: namespace ConsoleApplication1 { // Example Program class ShanuHouseClass { public int noOfTV = 0; private Boolean doYouHaveTV = true; protected String yourTVName = \"SAMSUNG\"; static void Main(string[] args) { ShanuHouseClass objHouseOwner = new ShanuHouseClass(); Console.WriteLine(\"You Have total \" + objHouseOwner.noOfTV + \" no of TV :\"); Console.WriteLine(\"Your TV Name is :\" + objHouseOwner.yourTVName); Console.ReadLine(); } } } In Above example program I have declared two variables inside a class. In main method I have created object for class. Here we can see using the object we can access the variable of a class and display the output. Main Method is the default Method of C#, where every console and windows application will start the program execution, In the Main Method, we can declare the Object for the class and use the object, and we can access all variables and Methods of a Class. For example, we can say there will be entrance gate for every house. Using the entrance gate we can enter inside our house. Similarly, to run our program there should be some default program execution starting Method. Main method will be useful in this program execution starting point. Whenever we run our C# Console or windows application, first the Main method will be executed .From the main method we can create an object for our other classes and call their Methods.

Method or Functions Method is a group of code statement .Now here we can see the above example program with method. class ShanuHouseClass { public int noOfTV = 2; private Boolean doYouHaveTV = true; protected String yourTVName = \"SAMSUNG\"; public void myFirstMethod() { Console.WriteLine(\"You Have total \" + noOfTV + \"no of TV :\"); Console.WriteLine(\"Your TV Name is :\" + yourTVName); Console.ReadLine(); } } class a { static void Main(string[] args) { ShanuHouseClass a = new ShanuHouseClass(); a.myFirstMethod(); } } Most of developers were wondering about what is the difference between the Method and Function, both Methods and Functions are the same. Here in my article, I will use Method instead of functions. However, there is one difference in Methods and Functions, In OOP Languages like C#, Java etc. We use the term Method while the non-OOP programming like C etc. we use the term Function. What is the use of Methods? Another real-time example let’s take our mobile phone, we can say as we have Mobile phone and store many Songs in it. However, we always like to listen to the selected songs. It will be boring and hard for us to select our favorite song every time and play it. Instead of doing the same work repeatedly, we use the playlist. In playlist, we can add all-favorite songs of ours. Just click on the playlist of our collections and listen to the music. This will make our work easier and we don’t need to do the same thing again and again. Methods are used like a playlist where we can write all our repeated code in one Method and just call the method wherever we needed. In a house, there might be one big room or multiple rooms but each room will have different facilities, similarly in a class we can write one or multiple Methods. In a house, there might be two or three Bedrooms. Here the room name is Bedroom, but each bedroom can be different by size, color etc. This means same Rooms with different type. Similarly, in a class we can create more than one method with the same name but different parameter. In OOP it’s called as Polymorphism we can see details about Polymorphism later on in this article. Syntax for the Functions Access-Modifiers Return-Type Method-Name (Parameter-List) Access-Modifiers: We will see more details about this Topic later on. Return-Type: If our Method returns any value then we use the return Type with any Data Type as String, int etc., if our Method does not return any value then we use the type “Void”. Method-Name: Here we give our Name for every Method, which we create Parameter-List: Parameter-List or Arguments, which we pass to the function. Here is an example of Method: Method with Void Type: Void is a keyword which will not return any data from the Method, for example we can see the below Method with void Type, here in this method we display all our output using the Console.WriteLine and have used the Console.ReadLine()); to get the Input. This Method has all Input and Output Operation but this method don’t return any value. // Function with void and no parameter -- here void means no return type public void veranda() { Console.WriteLine(\"Welcome to Veranda\"); Console.WriteLine(\"How Many Chairs Do you have in your Veranda\"); NoofChair = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine()); Console.WriteLine(\"I have total \" + NoofChair + \" Chairs in my Veranda\"); } Method with Return Type: Method with return type will return some result, which can be used in our program, for example, here we have Method TVNAME with return Type as String. We can say in our home we might have a TV in our LivingROOM and in the parent’s bedroom and also in kids bedroom .We might have different TV brand in each room, suppose if we want to know each room TV Brand Name then we need to enter the same code 3 times. Instead of writing the same code again, we can use a method with Return Type. // Function with Return type as String public string TVNAME() { String YOURTVName; Console.WriteLine(\"Enter Your TV Brand NAME\"); YOURTVName = Co","date":"April 11, 2017","objectID":"/2017-04-10-oops_concept/:0:4","tags":["C#","OOP","Object-oriented programming","Class","method"],"title":"Basic C# OOP Concept","uri":"/2017-04-10-oops_concept/"},{"categories":["OOP"],"content":"5. Access Modifiers Access Modifiers are nothing but the Usage and Limitation of our type like variable, Methods and Class. For Example we can say it as a security limit. This six are the basic Access modifiers which we used in our C# Class/method and in Variables. Private Let’s take our House Example .We will have a Security Guard in House, His duty is till the Entrance of the house. He cannot go inside the house and access all the things. In this case we can create a SecurityGuardClass and declare the variable and method for Security as private . Public House Owners are public to the class where they can access all classes related to the House. They have no restrictions to access their house. Internal Access limit of variable or method is within a project. For example let’s consider in our project we have more than one class and we have declared a variable as internal in one class. Let’s see an example program for internal variable. class Modifiers { public class sampleInternalClass { internal String myInternal = \"Iam Internal Variable\"; } class ShanuHouseClass { int noOfTV = 2; public String yourTVName = \"SAMSUNG\"; public void myFirstMethod() { Console.WriteLine(\"You Have total \" + noOfTV + \"no of TV :\"); Console.WriteLine(\"Your TV Name is :\" + yourTVName); } static void Main(string[] args) { ShanuHouseClass objHouseOwner = new ShanuHouseClass(); objHouseOwner.myFirstMethod(); sampleInternalClass intObj = new sampleInternalClass(); Console.WriteLine(\"Internal Variable Example :\" + intObj.myInternal); Console.ReadLine(); } } } Protected Only the main class and derived class can have access of protected variable or method. For example servants and Guests are example for the Protected. For Example Servants can go to all room and do cleaning and other activates. However, they have limitations of access in the house, as they cannot take rest in a bed of house owner. Protected Internal Protected Internal variable or Method has limitation with in a project of class or Derived class. Here is a sample program for Protect Internal Variable .In this example I have used the Inheritance .we will see in detail about Inheritance more detail in this article. public class sampleProtectedInternalClass { protected internal String myprotectedInternal = \"Iam Protected Internal Variable\"; public void protectedInternalMethod() { Console.WriteLine(\"Protected Internal Variable Example :\" + myprotectedInternal); } } public class derivedClass : sampleProtectedInternalClass { public void derivedprotectedInternal() { Console.WriteLine(\"Derived Protected Internal Variable Example :\" + myprotectedInternal); } } class ShanuHouseClass { int noOfTV = 2; public String yourTVName = \"SAMSUNG\"; public void myFirstMethod() { Console.WriteLine(\"You Have total \" + noOfTV + \"no of TV :\"); Console.WriteLine(\"Your TV Name is :\" + yourTVName); } static void Main(string[] args) { ShanuHouseClass objHouseOwner = new ShanuHouseClass(); objHouseOwner.myFirstMethod(); sampleProtectedInternalClass intObj = new sampleProtectedInternalClass(); intObj.protectedInternalMethod(); derivedClass proIntObj = new derivedClass(); proIntObj.derivedprotectedInternal(); Console.ReadLine(); } } The main and major things we need to know in OOP concept are Encapsulation, Abstraction,Polymorphism and Inheritance. We will discuss them in detail in this article.

Encapsulation Encapsulation is to hide the member or variable to outside class. In our house example, I have already told that House security guard limitation is till the entrance of the house. The security guard doesn’t need to know about what is happening inside the house. Therefore, the House Owner will hide all the happenings to Security guard for more safety. The hiding and limitation are called as Encapsulation. For example, we have two Classes the first one is Houseclass and the other class as houseSecurityClass. Here we can see all the variables are wrap into a class where houseSecurityClass is set as public, so the Houseclass can access that, but houseClass has both Public and private variable where the private variable of a class cannot be accessed outside of the class. //Encapsulation in OOP public class houseSecurityClass { public int noofSecurity; public String SecurityName = String.Empty; } public class Houseclass { private int noofLockerinHosue = 2; public string OwnerName = String.Empty; } ","date":"April 11, 2017","objectID":"/2017-04-10-oops_concept/:0:6","tags":["C#","OOP","Object-oriented programming","Class","method"],"title":"Basic C# OOP Concept","uri":"/2017-04-10-oops_concept/"},{"categories":["OOP"],"content":"7. Abstraction Abstraction is to show and share some common information to the user. Let’s take our House example, in our house we will have servant, servants can go to all rooms and do cleaning and other works. The house owner can give full rights or some partial rights to the servant for accessing his house. Here we can see an example program as private declared variables and Methods are not shared with servant but the public variable and Methods are shared with servant. public class HouseServerntClass { private int SaftyLoackerKeyNo = 10001; public String roomCleanInstructions = \"Clean All rooms\"; private void saftyNos() { Console.WriteLine(\"My SaftyLoackerKeyNo is\" + SaftyLoackerKeyNo); } public void roomCleanInstruction() { Console.WriteLine(roomCleanInstructions); } static void Main(string[] agrs) { HouseServerntClass a = new HouseServerntClass(); a.saftyNos(); a.roomCleanInstruction(); Console.ReadLine(); } } ","date":"April 11, 2017","objectID":"/2017-04-10-oops_concept/:0:7","tags":["C#","OOP","Object-oriented programming","Class","method"],"title":"Basic C# OOP Concept","uri":"/2017-04-10-oops_concept/"},{"categories":["OOP"],"content":"8. Inheritance Inheritance is used to reuse the code. In Protected Internal Access modifier section we have already seen an example program for Inheritance. Inheritance is nothing but accessing and using all base class variable and methods in the Derived Class. Inheritance can be Single level Inheritance With one Base class and one derived Class for example. public class baseClass { private void privateMethod() { Console.WriteLine(\"private Method\"); } public void publicMethod() { Console.WriteLine(\"This Method Shared\"); } } public class DerivedClass : baseClass { static void Main(string[] args) { DerivedClass obj = new DerivedClass(); obj.publicMethod(); //This will be error as private method can not be accessed in Derived Class  obj.privateMethod(); } } The Error is: Some time users might be not clear of what Base class is and what Derived class is. Base class is the super class and derived class is the classes which inherit the base class. Here we can see a simple Inheritance where the base class is the GuestVist and derived class is the HouseOwnerClass. Here HouseOwnerClass class inherits the base class of GuestVist Multi level Inheritance With more than one Derived Class for example. Here we can see an example first base class is derived in DerivedClass1 and then the DerivedClass1 is derived in DerivedClass2 .Now from DerivedClass2 we can access both baseClass and DerivedClass1 variable and methods. public class baseClass { private void privateMethod() { Console.WriteLine(\"private Method\"); } public void publicMethod() { Console.WriteLine(\"This Method Shared\"); } } public class DerivedClass1 : baseClass { public void DerivedClass1() { Console.WriteLine(\"Derived Class 1\"); } } public class DerivedClass2 : DerivedClass1 { static void Main(string[] args) { DerivedClass2 obj = new DerivedClass2(); obj.publicMethod(); obj.DerivedClass1(); //This will be error as private method can not be accessed in Derived Class  //obj.privateMethod(); } } Multiple Inheritance Will the .Net Support Multiple Inheritance? The Answer to this Question is No. In C #, it’s not possible to write a Multiple Inheritance using Class. What is Multiple Inheritance? Multiple Inheritance is nothing but we can have more than one class and we can inherit both Classes in our derived class. What will happen if I write a Multiple Class Inheritance Using C#? Let’s take our example House .Here we have the derived Class as HouseOwnerClass and have Two More classes as GuestVist and FriendsandRelationsClass. Now suppose for our house both Guest and Friend have visited. For this, we write above three classes and inherit the two classes in our derived class. When I write the Multiple Inheritance in C #, it will display the warning message during our code and execute our program. See the below image which shows the Warning error message while I write Multiple Inheritance. * Then how can we use the Multiple Inheritance Interface will be used for Multiple Inheritance.

Polymorphism Ploy means more than one form. In the beginning of the Article at Method Section, we have already seen an example of Polymorphism. Same method name with different parameter is an example for the polymorphism. Method Overloading and Method Overriding will be used in polymorphism. Polymorphism have two types of execution one is Compile Time Polymorphism and the other one is called the Run time Polymorphism. Method Overloading Method overloading are nothing but same Method name will be used for more than one method with different Argument. Here is an example program for the Method Overloading. As we can see here Method name BedRoom has been used for two Method but the parameter for both methods are different. class HouseOwnerClass { //Function with parameter  public void BedRoom(String nameandColor) { Console.WriteLine(nameandColor); } // Same Function Name with Different Paramenter  public void BedRoom(String MemberName, String Color) { Console.WriteLine(MemberName + \" Like \" + Color + \" Color\"); } static void Main(string[] args) { HouseOwnerClass objHouseOwner = new HouseOwnerClass(); objHouseOwner.BedRoom(\"My Name is Shanu I like Lavender color\"); objHouseOwner.BedRoom(\"My Name is Afraz I like Light Blue color\"); objHouseOwner.BedRoom(\"SHANU\", \"Lavender\"); Console.ReadLine(); } } Method Overriding The difference between the Method Overloading and Overriding are.In Method Overloading we will have same method name with different argument. In Method Overriding we will have same Method Name same Argument and same type but method overriding can only be used in the derived class, Method Overriding cannot be done in the same class. We will see how Method Overriding can be used in Abstract Method, Virtual Method and in Sealed Method kindly refer to that section in this article.

Abstract Class/Method Abstract Class: Abstract class will have a keyword abstract. The Abstract class will be as a super class for all our class. Abstract class cannot be accessed by an object, which means we cannot create an object for an abstract class. What will happen when we create an object for an Abstract Class? Here we can see an error warning message as “An instance of an abstract class cannot be created” when I try to create an object for my abstract class. Abstract class can have both Abstract Method and normal Method. In Abstract Class at least one Abstract Method should be declared. In addition, derived class should override the abstract method. To access the abstract method we should use the “override” keyword in our derived class. What will happen if we create an abstract method but which is not override in derived class? Here we can see an abstract class has an abstract method, But the abstract method is not override in the derived class. See the below image for the warning message displaying as class must implement the abstract member. Here we can see an example of Abstract Class and for Abstract Method in detail. In this example, we can see an abstract class, which has normal Method and Abstract Method. Abstract Methods; do not have body part in Abstract Class, which means we can only declare an Abstract Method at Abstract Class, There should be minimum one Abstract Method in an Abstract Class. public abstract class GuestVist { public void Guestwelcomemessage() { Console.WriteLine(\"Welcome to our AbstractHome\"); } public void GuestName() { Console.WriteLine(\"Guest name is: Abstract\"); } public abstract void purposeofVisit(); } // derived class to inherit the abstract class public class A : GuestVist { public override void purposeofVisit() { Console.WriteLine(\"Abstract just came for a Meetup and spend some time \"); } static void Main(string[] args) { A objHouse = new A(); objHouse.purposeofVisit(); objHouse.Guestwelcomemessage(); objHouse.GuestName(); Console.ReadLine(); } } ","date":"April 11, 2017","objectID":"/2017-04-10-oops_concept/:0:10","tags":["C#","OOP","Object-oriented programming","Class","method"],"title":"Basic C# OOP Concept","uri":"/2017-04-10-oops_concept/"},{"categories":["OOP"],"content":"11. Virtual Class/Method Virtual method is very useful in our day-to-day programming. What is virtual Method and what is the use of Virtual Method? Take our House example one guest confirms, as today total five persons will visit your home. For this, we write a function as message display as five Guest visiting our home. Once Guest visits, we see their total 20 persons have visited. In Some cases it might be increase or decrease we will come to know when they reach us. In that case, the guest will be as a Separate Class and House will be as separate class. Without changing the message in Guest class how can we change the data in our Derived class? What is the Difference between Abstract Method and Virtual Method? Both similarities use the override keyword. Abstract Method can only be declared in Abstract Class, which means no body part for abstract method in Abstract class. However, for virtual it can have body part. See the example program below. Here we have both Abstract Method and Virtual Method. In Abstract class, the virtual method says as total five guests but in the derived Class program, the message was override as 20 guests. See the final output in below. Guess what will be displayed for Virtual Method? Will the result be 5 Guests or 20 Guests check for the output below the program. public abstract class GuestVist { public abstract void purposeofVisit(); // Abstract Method  public virtual void NoofGuestwillvisit() // Virtual Method  { Console.WriteLine(\"Total 5 Guest will Visit your Home\"); } } class AbstractHouseClass : GuestVist { public override void purposeofVisit() // Abstract method Override  { Console.WriteLine(\"Abstract just for a Meetup and spend some time \"); } public override void NoofGuestwillvisit() // Virtual method override  { Console.WriteLine(\"Total 20 Guest Visited our Home\"); } static void Main(string[] args) { AbstractHouseClass objHouse = new AbstractHouseClass(); objHouse.purposeofVisit(); objHouse.NoofGuestwillvisit(); Console.ReadLine(); } } ","date":"April 11, 2017","objectID":"/2017-04-10-oops_concept/:0:11","tags":["C#","OOP","Object-oriented programming","Class","method"],"title":"Basic C# OOP Concept","uri":"/2017-04-10-oops_concept/"},{"categories":["OOP"],"content":"12. Sealed Class/Method Sealed Class: As name says this class cannot be inherited by other classes. Take our House Example. In a house, the Houseowner can have a secret room, as might be official or financial rooms. The owner don’t want others to access his official room. The sealed class will be useful in those cases. Sealed class can be declared using the keyword Sealed. If one class is declared as Sealed, it cannot be inherited in other derived classes. What will happen when we inherit sealed class in our derived class? Let’s see an example when I try to inherit my sealed class from my derived class. It shows me the below warning message. Here we can see an example program of Sealed Class. public sealed class OwnerofficialRoom { public void AllMyPersonalItems() { Console.WriteLine(\"All Items in this rooms are personal to me no one else can access or inherit me\"); } } class HouseSealedClass { static void Main(string[] args) { OwnerofficialRoom obj = new OwnerofficialRoom(); obj.AllMyPersonalItems(); Console.ReadLine(); } } Sealed Method: If we declared a method as sealed that specific method cannot be override in the derived class.

Static Class/Method We have already learned about what is Sealed Class in this Article; now let’s see what are Static Class and Static Method. Both Static and Sealed Class cannot be inherited. What is the Difference between Static Class and Sealed Class? We can create an Object (instance) for the Sealed Class, we can see in my sealed class section I have created a sample Sealed class and in Main Method I have created an object to access the sealed Class. And in a Sealed Class both Static and non-Static methods can be written. But for a Static Class it’s not possible to create an Object. In Static Class only Static members are allowed which means in a static Class it’s not possible to write non-static method. We can say our main method as an example for the Static method. When we create a console application in c# we can see each class will have a default main method. In my article I have explained that when an Console or Windows application start execute first the main method will be executed .There is no need to create an object for the main method since it was been declared as a static method. static void Main(string[] args) Another interesting one in Static class is that memory will be allocated for all static variable and methods during execution but for the non static variable and methods memory will be allocated only when the object for the class are created. Let’s take our same sealed class Example for our static Class and method. What will happen when we inherit Static class in our derived class? Let’s see an example when I try to inherit my static class from my derived class. It shows me the below warning message. What will happen when we declare non-Static method in a Static class? Let’s see an example when I try to create a non-Static method at my Static Class. What will happen when we create an object for the Static class? Let’s see an example when I try to create an object for my Static Class. When we run the program we get the error message as Can not create an instance of a static class How to call the Static Class Method and variable without creating the Object? It’s simple just we can use the ClassName.Variable or Method Name for example OwnerofficialRoom.AllMyPersonalItems(); See the below example with Static class public static class OwnerofficialRoom { public static void AllMyPersonalItems() { Console.WriteLine(\"All Items in this rooms are personal to me no one else can access or inherit me\"); } } class HouseStaticClass { static void Main(string[] args) { OwnerofficialRoom.AllMyPersonalItems(); Console.ReadLine(); } } Is that possible to create a Static Method in non-Static Class? The answer is yes. We can create a Static Method to the non Static class. No need to create an object to access the static method in non-static class. We can directly use the class name to access the Static method. See the below example with Static method in non-static Class. public class OwnerofficialRoom { public static void AllMyPersonalItems() { Console.WriteLine(\"No need to create object for me just use my class name to access me :)\"); } public void non_staticMethod() { Console.WriteLine(\"You need to create an Object to Access Me :(\"); } } class StaticmethodClass { static void Main(string[] args) { // for statci method no need to create object just call directly using the classname.  OwnerofficialRoom.AllMyPersonalItems(); // for non-static method need to create object to access the method.  OwnerofficialRoom obj = new OwnerofficialRoom(); obj.non_staticMethod(); Console.ReadLine(); } } ","date":"April 11, 2017","objectID":"/2017-04-10-oops_concept/:0:13","tags":["C#","OOP","Object-oriented programming","Class","method"],"title":"Basic C# OOP Concept","uri":"/2017-04-10-oops_concept/"},{"categories":["OOP"],"content":"14. Interface Interface is same like abstract class but in Interface we will have only method declaration but in abstract class we can have both method declaration and method definition .Methods of Interface must be implemented in a implementing class. See the below Example program for an Interface. All the methods of Interface have been implemented in the class. As I have already told you that c# don’t support multiple inheritance for using multiple inheritance we can use Interface. This below program is an example for multiple inheritance using Interface. interface GuestInterface { void GuestWelcomeMessage(); void NoofGuestes(); } interface FriendsandRelationsInterface { void friendwelcomemessage(); void FriendName();} class HouseOwnerClass : GuestInterface, FriendsandRelationsInterface { public void GuestWelcomeMessage() { Console.WriteLine(\"All guests are well come to our home\"); } public void NoofGuestes() { Console.WriteLine(\"Total 15 Guestes has visited\"); } public void friendwelcomemessage() { Console.WriteLine(\"Welcome to our Home\"); } public void FriendName() { Console.WriteLine(\"Friend name is: Afraz\"); } static void Main(string[] args) { HouseOwnerClass obj = new HouseOwnerClass(); obj.GuestWelcomeMessage(); obj.NoofGuestes(); obj.friendwelcomemessage(); obj.FriendName(); Console.ReadLine(); } } In some cases we need to have certain methods which will be used in many derived classes. Each derived can implement different functionality for those Methods. In These cases, we can use the Interface. We can say our Guest and house example. For Guest the Welcome Message and No of Guest Function are common, but it will be different for different owners in the same house, Guest might a fathers guest, Mothers Guest, Children’s Guest or Family Guest. Each guest can have different welcome message subject, but the functions are same as Message .let’s consider now Father is a Class, Mother is a class and Children are one Class. Both guestWelcome Message and Noofguest method are same for all. In this case, we can create an Interface and declare both methods in the Interface. All father, mother and Children Classes can inherit the interface and write their own method details. Interface is similar to Abstract class but the major difference between the Abstract Class and the Interface are .In Abstract Class there can be both Abstract Method and Non Abstract methods .But in Interface all methods are abstract by default which means there is no non Abstract type method in the Interface. All the Methods declared in Interface should be override in the derived class. What will happen when non-abstract methods with body part are declared in an Interface? It will display the warning message as unexpected modifier in Access modifier part and Unexpected Method body error warning at message Body. This article repost from here under markdown format.

This is useful if you want to specifically state do nothing so that someone else doesn’t try to correct what seems to be an omission. Restricted: This will prevent the record from being deleted if there are records in the related table that match the selected relation. This occurs within the validateDelete table event, which is called by the delete table event. Cascade: This will delete the record in the related table, based on the relation. Ex: A sales order line is of no use without a sales order. This is an extension of the delete table event. Cascade + Restricted This is a little special. In a two-table scenario, it is the same as Restricted. It will stop the record from being deleted if a related record exists. But if the record is being deleted as part of a cascade from a table related to it, the records will be deleted. for more infomation about how to create DeleteActions at MSDN.

Using methods from this class allow you to be very precise about what dates you want to use in reports or for filtering your data. Let’s say you have a report that you always want to run to see orders with shipping dates of the next day. It is possible to do so by using one of the methods from the SysQueryRangeUtil. The use of the letter ’t' will work for today’s date, but when you try to add days to it, it doesn’t work in reports. Instead, I will use the currentdate() method and add 1 to it. All methods \u0026 expressions must be surrounded by parentheses as shown below. Filtering the requested ship dates in an AX query for tomorrow (current day() + 1) On any form with a grid, you filter your data by pressing Ctrl+G. If I were to want to see open customer invoices from the last 90 days, I would filter my open customer invoices form and use the method (dayRange(-90,0)). The first number represents how many months backward from this month, and the second represents how many months forward. The same sorts of things can be done for the monthRange(), yearRange(), and dateRange() methods. The best part about this is that you can of course save these filters to create views that you might use on a daily basis. If you are creating your query ranges in code, these methods can also be utilized whenever you are setting them. Definitely be sure to check out the SysQueryRangeUtil class as there are many more methods to use. Here is some methods you can use: currentCustomerAccount() currentVendorAccount() currentUserId() currentDate() dateRange() day() dayRange() greaterThanDate() greaterThanUtcDate() greaterThanUtcNow() lessthanDate() lessthanUtcDate() lessthanUtcNow() monthRange() yearRange() for example: (dayRange(-30,0)) – Results in a date range for the last 30 days: \"26-01-2017\"..\"25-02-2017\" (day(-1)) – Results in yesterday's date: 24-02-2017 (day(0)) – Results in today's date: 25-02-2017 (day(1)) – Results in tomorrow's date: 26-02-2017 (greaterThanDate(2)) – Results in every date after today plus 2: \u003e 27-02-2017 (lessThanDate(-1)) – Results in every date of today minus 1: \u003c 24-02-2017 (monthRange(0,2)) – Results in first day till the last day of the month's choosen (0 = current month): \"01-02-2017\"..\"30-04-2017\" (yearRange(-1,-1)) – Results in first day till the last day of the chosen year: \"01-01-2017\"..\"31-12-2017\" Thank you for reading!

The Microsoft Dynamics AX runtime also performs memory deallocation (garbage collection) for these objects when they are no longer referenced. Reference variables declared as record types reference objects that the Microsoft Dynamics AX runtime instantiates automatically.

A document service is composed of the following components: Document query : This is a query that is created in the Application Object Tree (AOT) and contains all the tables that are related to the business object that you want to expose. Based on this query, the Document Service Generation Wizard can be used to generate the other artifacts that make up the document service. Table AxBC classes : An AxBC class is a wrapper for a table and contains business logic that is needed for Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations. Document class : The purpose of the document class is to contain business logic that is associated with the creation and modification of the business entity itself. For example, the AxdCustomer class could contain logic to handle party information of a customer. Document service class : This is the actual service implementation class and extends the AifDocumentService class. This class implements the service operations that are published through the service contract. When creating document services, developers need to make sure that the business object is mapped correctly to the document query. The document services framework will handle all other things such as the serialization and deserialization of XML, date effectiveness, and so on. Document services can be deployed using the integration ports and all available adapters can be used. Custom services Custom services were already available in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009, but support for Extended Data Types(EDTs) was limited, which resulted in developers having to provide custom serialization and deserialization logic. Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 introduces the concept of attributes. Attributes provide a way to specify metadata about classes and methods. Two of these attributes are used when creating data contracts: the DataContractAttribute and DataMemberAttribute attributes. The ‘DataContractAttribute’ attribute is used to define that a class is a data contract. The’DataMemberAttribute' attribute is added to methods of data contracts that represent data members that have to be exposed. This way of defining data contracts is very similar to other programming languages such as C#. Support for more complex data types such as collections and tables has been added so that these types can be serialized and deserialized without developers having to provide the logic themselves. In a typical custom service you will find the following components: Service contract : A service contract is an X++ class that contains methods with the SysEntryPointAttribute attribute. This identifies methods that will result in a service operation contract when the service is exposed. Data contracts : A data contract is an X++ class that is attributed with the DataContractAttribute attribute. It contains parameter methods that will be attributed as data members for each member variable that needs to be part of the data contract. Custom services can be deployed using the integration ports and any available adapter can be used. System services These services are new since the release of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012. The main difference between these services and the previous two types is that they are not customizable and are not mapped to a query or X++ code. They are not customizable because they are written by Microsoft in managed code. One exception is the user session service, which is written in X++ code but is generally considered as a system service. There are three system services available for use in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012: the query service, the metadata service, and the user session service. Query service The query service provides the means to run queries of the following three types: Static queries defined in the AOT. User-defined queries by using the QueryMetaData class in the service. Dynamic queries that are written in X++ ","date":"November 10, 2016","objectID":"/2016-11-10-types-services-microsoft-dynamics-ax-2012/:0:0","tags":["aif","xpp","aos"],"title":"Types of services in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012","uri":"/2016-11-10-types-services-microsoft-dynamics-ax-2012/"},{"categories":["AX 2012","Data"],"content":"SUMMARY Tool can be used for two different purposes.

The tool minimally changes data during the import process. The only data the tool changes are the entity IDs (IDs related to table, field, etc.) that are stored as data and that could change with each deployment.

By calling the web services that are exposed by the report server, the report control in the Web Part displays information that is contained in Reporting Services reports. These reports can include either transnational data from the Microsoft Dynamics AX application or OLAP cubes from Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services. Cubes provide business analytic and key performance indicators (KPIs). The client provides workflow forms, alerts, and controls so that users can participate in the business process by using the Workflow system. The Workflow system is a Microsoft Dynamics AX component that enables workflow processes by using Windows Communication Foundation classes. The client provides a Help viewer, which is an application that displays context-sensitive Help topics. The Help topics are retrieved from a Help server that is located on-premises. The client also provides Role Centers, or role-based home pages, for users. Role Centers provide role-specific tasks, activities, alerts, reports, and business intelligence that help users increase their productivity. To interact with the Role Centers that are provided by Enterprise Portal and hosted on Internet Information Services (IIS), the client uses a browser control.

External applications and client applications on the local area network consume AX services by accessing them directly from AOS. These clients and applications include AX components such as the AX client, Office Add-, and Enterprise Portal. Internet-based external applications and clients access the AX services through Internet Information Services (IIS). IIS routes the incoming requests for AX services to AOS. All services requests, regardless of their origin, are handled by the WCF runtime that is hosted on AOS. The AIF request preprocessor, if it is configured, can intercept the inbound request messages for custom preprocessing, such as message transforms or value substitutions. The AX service invokes the necessary business logic to process the inbound request message. Similarly, the AIF response postprocessor, if it is configured, can intercept the outbound response messages for custom post-processing, such as message transforms or value substitutions. The AIF response postprocessor then returns the response to the client.

I mean, programming, and lovin’ it. Even if I’m not so good. helloworldhelloworld \" helloworld I’ve heard a thousand of guys telling stories like: “When I was twelve my parents bought me my first computer and I started learning on my own.” or “I won a programming contest when I was in highschool”. Great. Well done. I’ve never noticed about what coding was until I was eighteen, when I had to decide what to study at the University. Do you want to know what was I thinking about? First option: Computer Science. Second option: Arts (wtf?). Third option: Philosophy (WTF?). I’ve ever liked computers, yes, but I’d never thought I could do that amazing things with them. I also liked maths, puzzles, things that made my brain think hard and get fun at the same time. You know, quizes, enigmas, games… The conclusion was that I wanted to do something creative, where I could put my imagination on, where I could challenge myself in order to create new stuff. My first programming class was awful. I didn’t get nothing, and everyone seemed to be so cool on it, everyone with this big “Hello World” in their screens and a smile in their faces like ‘Yeah dude, I did it.”. I didn’t even know what to write down, or what was the teacher talking about. I was so frustrated, my first exam was… well, I don’t want to talk about my first exam. One day, I don’t know how, something changed. Suddenly, I realized what programming was. I really abstracted my mind, I looked at it from another perspective, and it came with me so clear and so beautiful and I can not explain with words what I felt. Was it easier from then? Not at all. In fact, I left Computer Science after the first year, with almost all the subjects passed, because there was still something that made me think I was not made for it. I was so lost, I didn’t know what to do with my life. I really liked programming, but there were so much thinks that seemed to be so far away from me. And I felt that everyone around me was going good on it, it was so frustrating that I couldn’t stand it anymore. Then, I decided I had to change my situation because there should be something out there waiting for me. I looked for other degrees in a lot of universities. It was. I do really love what I’m studying now, but the truth is that I think I’ve found my way. Actually, I will finish also Computer Science someday, but in a different place. And I’m still getting frustrated, of course, who doesn’t?, but I know I learned to love that frustration. Let me explain myself. Programming is that. Is try it out thousand of times. Is try to find a mistake between a million lines of code, it’s to abstract your mind to find an answer, it’s… beautiful. I know really good programmers that honestly, I think I’ll never reach out, I have not that brilliant brain. But I keep on trying it, I’m not the best, I just love what I do. Maybe this post is not just about programming, maybe is more about to find out what do you really love. Even if sometimes you hate it, or it makes you cry, or it makes you feel so stupid because you are not able to understand it, or if it makes you think there is a lot of people smarter than you doing the same thing better. Just… enjoy your time, fight for what you want, challenge yourself to go to the next step.
