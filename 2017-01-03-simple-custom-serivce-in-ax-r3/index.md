# Simple summary Keys are in Dynamics AX


* There is a maximum of one `Primary Key` per table, whereas a table can have several `alternate keys`. The `primary key` is usually the type of key that other tables, called child tables, refer to when a `foreign key` field in those other tables need a relational identifier.

* For new tables the default is a `primary key` based on the `RecId` field , incremented number or a completely meaningless number that is generated by the system `surrogate key`.

* `Alternate key` can be chosen as the `Replacement Key` of a table that can display on forms instead of a meaningless numeric `primary key` value. Each table can have a maximum of one `replacement key`.

* `Natural key` has meaning to people. Most `replacement keys` are `natural keys`.

* Relations represents a `foreign key`.
