You can add actions by adding a method to the data entity and then decorating the method with specific attributes <em>[SysODataActionAttribute]</em></p>
<p>I use this Odata actions mostly in automation job like after refreshing data from PROD to UAT, we need to enable users, assign company to users, enable batches &hellip;

I’m very happy to announce a good news for you the Dynamics365 F&amp;O Community. I’ve got a little gift for you, as part of the new LCS API.
If you were, like me as an AX 2012 or F&amp;O Technical/Architect Consultant, you probably already suffered from not being able to offer customers the ability to automatically refresh your database from one environment to other.
